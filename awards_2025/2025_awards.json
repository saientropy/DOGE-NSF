    "abstractText": "When analyzing large systems that have an enormous number of possibilities, studying collections of randomly selected pieces can provide an effective way to understand likely properties or behaviors of the entire system. Random sampling can be applied to polling, estimating quantities in physical systems, detecting gerrymandering, and more. However, it is challenging to do random sampling in a way that is both fast and accurate. This project will study the fundamental mathematics behind methods for random sampling, including introducing new sampling methods, developing new tools to analyze existing sampling methods, and finding problems amenable to the new approaches the investigator develops. One goal is to improve methods used to quantify and detect gerrymandering, making those methods both faster and more reliable. Part of the award will support a summer program where students learn about math, computer science, and data science motivated by problems related to democracy.    This project considers random sampling of structures on graphs, such as spin configurations on the vertices of a graph or partitions of a graph into connected pieces. In one direction, the investigator will consider Pirogov-Sinai theory (PST), an approach from statistical physics that could help advance the state-of-the-art in sampling/counting algorithms for spin systems and more. Specific questions include adapting PST from infinite to finite settings; using PST and the additional probabilistic information it conveys to develop new Markov chain sampling algorithms; and exploring other statistical physics ideas that can lead to algorithmic breakthroughs. In another direction, tree-based methods have emerged as a promising way to sample connected graph partitions, but existing algorithms remain insufficient for fast, provably accurate sampling in general settings. Work on this project will address this gap, building on insights from a recent breakthrough result. This is closely tied to broader questions about the combinatorial and probabilistic structure of random trees and random walks, Markov chain mixing under non-local constraints, and duality in non-planar graphs. As political districting plans can be viewed as connected balanced partitions of population-weighted graphs (and random sampling algorithms are widely used to detect gerrymandering, understand possible plans, and advocate for voting rights, including in court), advances in efficiently generating these structures have broad implications for political science and important societal impact.

    "abstractText": "Graphs are used to model transportation networks, social networks, the internet, and many other systems of major significance. A number of important computational problems naturally arise on these graphs. For example, one may wish to find the shortest route visiting all points \u2013 in other words, to solve the traveling salesperson problem. Unfortunately, this problem and many others like it are believed to be computationally intractable, requiring lifetimes of computation to solve exactly. However, in many cases, it is computationally tractable to find an approximate solution, such that the cost of the proposed solution is guaranteed to be not much worse than the best cost achievable. The guarantee is usually that the ratio of the cost of the generated solution to the cost of the best solution is at most some quantity, called the approximation factor. This proposal aims to find fast algorithms with low approximation factors, obtaining high-quality approximate solutions to such problems. The project also aims to broaden participation in mathematics and computing via undergraduate research, an educational website, and an interdisciplinary course.    More specifically, the goal of this research is to develop new tools for approximating NP-hard graph problems and to improve our understanding of powerful techniques such as max entropy sampling and iterative rounding. Through studying these methods, this project will deepen the connections between approximation algorithms and other areas of computer science and math like graph theory, graph sparsification, and the geometry of polynomials. To pursue these goals, the investigator will focus on finding better approximation algorithms for several time-tested, fundamental graph problems including the traveling salesperson problem, its asymmetric variant, and a generalization of the minimum spanning tree problem known as k-edge-connected spanning subgraph (k-ECSS). All the problems considered are related to long-standing conjectures in mathematics and combinatorial optimization which will be examined alongside the algorithmic questions.

    "abstractText": "Resource scheduling is a critical component of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Despite extensive literature on scheduling, new challenges continue to arise due to advancements in hardware, software, and evolving models, metrics, and performance demands. Today\u2019s HPC systems operate on an unprecedented scale, presenting significant challenges for resource management, particularly when facing uncertainty introduced by emerging application characteristics and system-level complexities. Existing schedulers lack robust mechanisms to effectively handle uncertainty, limiting their ability to achieve optimal performance. This project takes on the grand challenge of scheduling HPC resources under uncertainty by introducing an integrated approach that combines algorithm and machine learning (ML). The approach leverages the rigor of algorithmic analysis to provide performance guarantees while utilizing ML\u2019s predictive capabilities to manage uncertainty effectively. The anticipated outcome is a substantial enhancement to current HPC schedulers, enabling more efficient execution of a diverse range of scientific applications, such as neuroscience, medical research, climate modeling, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, the project includes a series of synergistic activities, including outreach programs, curriculum development, and student recruitment, aimed at engaging students from K-12 through graduate levels. These efforts focus particularly on underrepresented and underserved communities, offering research opportunities that foster success in STEM and CS education.    Technically, this project aims to design, implement, and evaluate scheduling algorithms that integrate ML prediction models to enhance efficiency. The focus will be on addressing three primary sources of uncertainty: (1) inherent runtime variability of emerging applications; (2) resource contention in job co-scheduling; and (3) structural variations within dynamic workflows. These aspects represent uncertainties across temporal, spatial, and structural dimensions, all of which demand solutions due to their growing prevalence in modern HPC environments. Algorithmically, approximation and semi-online algorithms will be developed to provide performance guarantees relative to theoretical lower bounds for metrics such as job completion time and resource utilization. On the ML front, various models, including those based on regression and reinforcement learning, will be trained to deliver accurate predictions for job runtime, performance degradation, and structural variability. A key ambition of this project is to establish an incubation framework that enables the effective integration of heuristic-based algorithms and data-driven ML models. This approach aims to achieve a level of performance that neither paradigm could accomplish independently. The framework will offer a novel perspective on resource management and potentially set the stage for future HPC advancements.

    "abstractText": "This award supports research that studies how tissues modify their structure over time and how these changes are influenced by mechanical loading. The research focuses on the aortic valve leaflet, a vital part of the heart that opens and closes to control blood flow. The cells in the leaflet are constantly remodeling: building, breaking down, and rearranging the supportive material around them\u2014based on various stimuli, including mechanical loading. However, these structural changes also affect the mechanical loading on the leaflet, creating a feedback loop that is not yet fully understood. In calcific valve disease, this process leads to the thickening and hardening of the leaflet, preventing it from opening properly. This increases the workload on the heart, ultimately leading to heart failure. To investigate this feedback loop, this project will: 1) Develop a new method to measure how the material properties of the leaflet vary across its surface and over time and 2) Use advanced imaging techniques to study the leaflet's structure at different scales, particularly around small calcium deposits (microcalcifications) that stiffen the valve and reduce its function. The developed technology and research findings will also enable future studies aimed at slowing, stopping, or even reversing the formation and growth of microcalcifications.    This work will help to elucidate the role of mechanics during aortic valve leaflet remodeling. Remodeling is a continuous process: as cells synthesize, degrade, and rearrange their local extracellular matrix, its load-bearing properties change, which in turn alters local mechanical stimuli. This study will be the first to quantify the temporal changes in the regional mechanics and structure of individual aortic valve leaflets during culture. To do this the research team will develop a novel, structure-informed nonlinear anisotropic inverse mechanics method that quantifies spatially variable material properties from biaxial testing data. The team will also determine the multiscale structure of the leaflets at multiple time points during culture using quantitative polarized light imaging, a mesoscale imaging technique, to guide the application of microscale imaging. This will provide a detailed characterization of the extracellular matrix structure at and around microcalcifications as they form and grow. The spatial and temporal information collected in this study will enable to better understand the feedback mechanisms between leaflet mechanics and remodeling. Additionally, because this technology enables both spatial and temporal studies, results will be useful for future testing hypothesis concerning the underlying mechanisms of microcalcification formation and evaluating potential treatments.

    "abstractText": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports studying the relationship between microscopic structure (\u2018microstructure\u2019) and macroscopic function of cartilage when forces are applied that are similar to what is experienced in everyday life. Cartilage health is important to human health, as the main feature of osteoarthritis is cartilage loss. Osteoarthritis is a painful disease that affects about 30 million adults in the United States. Once a person loses cartilage, there is no treatment to regrow cartilage. Currently, little is known about cartilage microstructure, forces, and function, especially from measurements made in young and middle-aged adults before osteoarthritis usually begins. While new medical imaging tools provide an exciting opportunity to see changes in microstructure before cartilage loss, how much altered microstructure relates to cartilage function is still unknown. Proposed research will improve our current scientific understanding of cartilage and help patients at risk for osteoarthritis in the future. Community outreach events will engage and inspire middle and high school students from Vermont and include hands-on activities that show how changing what a material is made of impacts its function.     The research project investigates the links between quantitative magnetic resonance imaging metrics of cartilage microstructure, experimentally derived function of articular cartilage, and statistical modeling of bone shape. The studies supported in this project employ in vivo experiments, in situ testing, and in silico computational simulations. In vivo experimentation will leverage recently developed quantitative magnetic resonance imaging metrics of microstructure in cartilage, as assessed in a traditional \u2018unloaded\u2019 state, and bone shape to accurately predict changes with loading and subsequent relaxation. In situ testing will assess the capacity of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging metrics to predict the results of viscoelastic tests. In silico computational simulations will be developed and benchmarked for improving subject-specific computational models of joint mechanics by updating biphasic material properties with image-based measurements of articular cartilage microstructure. Overall, this research work will generate comprehensive and novel understanding of cartilage microstructure, response to load (with subsequent relaxation), and statistical shape modeling of bone to-date, advancing knowledge of multiscale structure-function relationships in articular cartilage by combining imaging experiments, biomechanical tests, and computational simulations. The benchmarked computational framework has the potential to transform subject-specific modeling in articular cartilage, which has broad implications for the field of biomechanics and computational modeling.

Aphids are among the most invasive animal species and the most important agricultural pests. This research project aims to increase our ability to predict and prevent disruptive invasions by analyzing phylogenetic and ecological patterns in the diversity of aphids, their environments, and the drivers of invasiveness in the group. By providing opportunities for student training and international collaboration, it also aims to develop the scientific literacy and human capital needed to address the challenges of biological invasions.    The specific goals of this project are to (i) estimate phylogenetic relationships among aphid lineages, (ii) use comparative phylogenetic analyses to shed light on the drivers of biological invasion, and (iii) extend the reach of practical biodiversity science. For the first goal, researchers will obtain and analyze target-enriched genomic data sampled from approximately 700 aphid species. These data will be used to advance the phylogenetic systematics of aphids. For the second goal, researchers will use phylogenetic path model analyses to test integrative hypotheses about the causal relationships between variation in aphid invasiveness, niche identity, niche breadth, reproductive output, dispersiveness, and the ecological similarity between source and recipient areas. For the third goal, researchers across the US, Canada and France will collaborate to train undergraduate and graduate students, and outreach in Alabama about regional insect ecology and invasion biology. Beyond these goals, this project will develop biodiversity data infrastructure in ways that will facilitate other lines of basic and applied comparative research, for example, research addressing general questions about the evolution of geographic ranges, and the responses of natural populations to climate change.

For consumers, manufacturing systems with mass individualization capabilities will create enhanced customer experience and enable the development of tailored solutions based on their unique requirements. For manufacturers, developing mass individualization capabilities could offer significant competitive advantages over manufacturers offering a single product or product family.

This field of optimization relies on mathematical disciplines such as graph theory, algebra, and topology to design efficient algorithms.

Approximation algorithms offer a practical approach by providing solutions that are guaranteed to be close to the optimum, measured by a predefined approximation ratio between the cost of the generated solution and the cost of the optimal solution. This project addresses key challenges in designing such algorithms, focusing on a fundamental type of problems in computer science called constraint satisfaction problems.

Additionally, by connecting research to education, the project prepares undergraduate and graduate students for careers in computational fields and enhances participation from historically underrepresented groups in STEM.    The proposed research includes three main components: (1) developing a mathematical framework to characterize the approximation thresholds of satisfiable finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), building on the foundational dichotomy theorem for CSPs; (2) advancing the understanding of Ordering Constraint Satisfaction Problems, a variant of CSPs, by leveraging their structural properties to design efficient approximation algorithms; and (3) applying the developed mathematical tools to address important problems in additive combinatorics and complexity theory. These efforts aim to enrich the theoretical understanding of optimization and computation by building on deep mathematical principles and exploring their connections to algorithm design.

    "abstractText": "Synchronous programming languages offer order-of-magnitude improvements in reliability and responsiveness in software systems. They have been used in safety-critical systems such as the virtual display systems of civilian and military aircraft at Dassault Aviation, the control software of the N4 nuclear power plants, and the Airbus A320 fly-by-wire system, among others. The success is largely due to the radically different way these programming languages work. As one example, built into these programming languages is the notion of a \"reaction\" that is completely isolated from the environment, which makes reasoning about the correctness of the program significantly easier than it is in conventional programming languages. Despite the significant success in these safety-critical domains, most programmers remain unaware of and unable to use these programming languages because the languages are deeply tied to specific environments, requiring specialized tools that do not work in every context. In this project, the investigators plan to bring the power of synchronous programming to general-purpose programming systems by solving technical challenges that currently limit the adoption of these important languages.    The major technical challenge stems from the radically different semantics that synchronous languages have. This different semantics has led to an entirely different compiler and tool-chain for programs using these languages. The investigators have two different implementation strategies, specifically for Esterel-inspired programming languages that both offer the opportunity of a connection to conventional programming languages. These techniques allow reuse of the tool-chain and existing libraries in the conventional languages' ecosystem while still offering the advantages of the synchronous programming model. One implementation relies on existing ideas for compiling Esterel, but views Esterel programs as data structures in the conventional language, in a shallow embedding manner, invoking the Esterel compiler at the hosts\u2019 runtime to interpret and execute Esterel code. The other implementation is novel and based on a deep embedding, relying on multi-shot continuations. The project's novelties are a new semantics for the continuation-based approach to Esterel as well as novel debugging techniques. The project's impacts are to bring Esterel to a modern generation of programmers, hopefully eventually leading to more reliable and robust software.

    "abstractText": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project seeks to understand the engineering rules that drive cytoskeletal coordination and sensing. Cells serve as nature's smart materials, capable of repairing, reorganizing, and sensing their surroundings. A crucial part of this cellular machinery is the cytoskeleton, which is a dynamic network of proteins that generates force and movement. However, how the parts of the cytoskeleton work together at the molecular level to accomplish larger tasks necessary for life is not understood. The knowledge gained in this project will contribute deeper insight to life\u2019s fundamental mechanisms. It will also provide tools to support challenges in bioengineering, such as creating cells from the bottom up or developing smart materials inspired by biological systems. Outreach and educational programs that build from these research efforts include creating summer research opportunities for student parents and establishing \u201cTeach Through Outreach\u201d, an outreach-based learning program for engineering students. Both have the overarching goal of broadening participation and increasing STEM exposure to underprivileged students in Mississippi.    The cytoskeleton exhibits emergent properties meaning that its ensemble behavior is not simply the sum of its parts. Myosin II is a cytoskeletal motor protein essential for basic cellular functions, and its motility and force generation behavior are significantly different at the single molecule level versus when part of a larger group. Yet, what tells the motor how to behave in different environments in not understood. By \u201csequencing\u201d the actomyosin mechanome, or the interconnected system of forces, mechanics, and machinery, the aim of this research is to systematically identify which environmental factors lead to specific motor behaviors. This understanding will advance the field of biomechanics and mechanobiology by revealing how motor proteins work together, adapt to mechanical signals within the cell, and contribute to essential processes like cell movement and division. The research goals of the project are to (1) evaluate how myosin ensemble synergy is influenced by soluble mechanical modulators, (2) understand how the mechanosensitive environment within the cytoskeletal network affects myosin force generation, and (3) investigate how the stiffness of the environment changes force output of motor protein ensembles. These goals will be accomplished through engineering customizable cytoskeletal ensembles in vitro and investigating their behavior using optical tweezers, fluorescence imaging, and a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. This project has the potential to further scientific discovery through enabling construction of minimalistic cell models to understand cellular processes and phenotypes, adding to the toolbox for creating biomimetic smart materials, and elucidating mechanisms of diseases that rely on mechanical feedback.

    "abstractText": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the go-to choice for deep learning due to their exceptional computational power and massive parallelism. However, maximizing GPU performance for model development and inference remains notoriously challenging as models grow increasingly complex, spanning multiple abstraction layers: the upstream Python layer, the midstream C/C++ layer, and the downstream GPU kernel layer. While this layered complexity meets diverse application needs, it also embeds inefficiencies that are difficult to detect due to intricate cross-layer interactions. The project addresses these inefficiencies through a comprehensive, cross-layer performance analysis of deep learning models. The project\u2019s novelties are advancing state-of-the-art profiling techniques to enable systemic performance tuning across all layers. The project's broader significance and importance are deepening the understanding of systemic performance issues in deep learning, thus strengthening foundations in code analysis and advancing progress in fields increasingly reliant on deep learning, such as image processing. With interest from industry leaders like Meta, the project shows strong potential for translating academic insights into practical applications. Additionally, the project contributes to educational and outreach goals by integrating its findings into computer science curricula and K-12 programs to cultivate a workforce skilled in performance analysis and optimization.    Three innovative analysis techniques structure the project. (1) Unified binary code analysis: It consolidates all layers of deep learning models into a shared binary abstraction, enabling the identification of cross-layer inefficiencies in code segments and data objects. (2) Incremental analysis: It incrementally narrows the scope of monitored performance metrics to pinpoint the root causes of inefficient code segments identified in the unified binary analysis. (3) Data object analysis: It addresses inefficient data objects identified in the unified binary analysis to diagnose their root causes. Together, these techniques form a comprehensive approach to performance tuning, addressing inefficiencies from a systemic perspective and maximizing GPU capabilities in deep learning.

    "abstractText": "Quantum simulation offers exciting opportunities to explore complex phenomena that are too difficult for traditional computers to handle, such as how materials might exhibit superconductivity at high temperatures or the behavior of fundamental particles and forces. Advancements in quantum simulation could transform fields like materials science, drug discovery, and fundamental physics. However, current quantum computers, known as Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, face challenges with errors and limited computing power. This project aims to overcome these obstacles by improving NISQ devices using a technique called Quantum Pulse Processing. This approach integrates advanced control techniques with algorithm design to minimize noise and enhance the efficiency of quantum simulations, paving the way for applications across physics, chemistry, and engineering. This research will contribute novel tools and frameworks that significantly enhance NISQ devices\u2019 ability to address computational tasks beyond classical reach, bridging digital and analog quantum methods, and supporting the development of a quantum-ready workforce through open-source tools and educational resources. By fostering scientific progress in quantum technology, this work supports the National Science Foundation\u2019s mission and strengthens the nation\u2019s leadership in this transformative field.     The project leverages Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) principles, extending them to a quantum pulse-level control framework to facilitate more flexible and efficient quantum programming. By integrating pulse-level control optimization into quantum simulation, this research aims to create a hybrid framework that combines the programmability of gate-based methods with the efficiency of analog pulse-level approaches. Key research directions include developing scalable multi-qubit control protocols to mitigate analog errors, creating robust hybrid digital-analog simulation algorithms that improve programmability and error resilience, and implementing scalable characterization methods for quantum control. Additionally, engineered dissipation methods will be employed to improve simulation fidelity against realistic noise, especially for simulating intricate physical phenomena like high-temperature superconductivity. Validation and deployment will be conducted through collaborative experimentation with academic and industry partners, with algorithms tested on diverse quantum platforms, including superconducting qubits, ion traps, and neutral atoms.

    "abstractText": "Carbon emissions from powering information and computing technologies (ICT) are projected to increase to 8% of worldwide carbon emissions over the next decade due to the explosion of computing required in everyday consumer electronic devices and systems. Recent studies have shown that integrated electro-photonics-based fabrics (the base layer chips are built on) for communication and computing, compared to conventional electronic fabrics, can result in substantially higher energy and carbon efficiency (up to 100\u00d7 in some cases) for future computing hardware platforms. This project leverages the energy efficiency of electro-photonic hardware fabrics to investigate their embodied carbon efficiency (related to carbon emissions due to hardware manufacturing and product infrastructure-related activities) following the universally accepted sustainability tenets of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. The goal is to develop an infrastructure for designing sustainable computing platforms using carbon-efficient electro-photonic hardware components. The project\u2019s novelties are (1) employing the principles of heterogeneity, reconfigurability, and recycling to design multi-functional and multi-lifespan electro-photonic transceiver and accelerator architectures, (2) transforming the sustainability, performance, resource utilization, and lifetime reliability of electro-photonics-based computing platforms using carbon-efficient cross-layer design techniques, and (3)creating novel educational materials using newly developed tutorial videos and interactive simulation modules to give students a more tangible, hands-on approach to learning the fundamentals of integrated electro-photonics and sustainable computing hardware design. The project's broader significance and importance are based on (i) creating opportunities for industrial partnerships (CMC Microsystems and GlobalFoundries), (ii) promoting outreach to the local community, (iii) engaging undergraduate students in supervised research, and (iv) promoting diversity by training STEM teachers of local middle schools that primarily serve underrepresented groups.     The overarching goal of this project is to reduce the impact of embodied energy and extend the operational lifetime of electro-photonic hardware components to enhance the sustainability and carbon efficiency of computing systems. This project is expected to result in (1) a framework that factors in the critical impacts of yield, variations in fabrication-process and temperature, and aging effects for modeling the embodied and use-phase carbon footprints of electro-photonic transceivers and accelerators, (2) carbon-efficient organizations of electro-photonic transceivers and accelerators with minimal carbon footprints and maximal lifespans, (3) methods to repurpose electro-photonic hardware components for multiple functionalities to minimize resource idle time and embodied carbon emissions, (4) cross-layer techniques to extend the reliable utilization of designed electro-photonic architectures across multiple lifespans, and (5) an extensive simulation framework for evaluation, validation, and comparison of different organizations of heterogeneous computing platforms comprising electro-photonic fabrics, focusing on various important metrics for energy efficiency, carbon efficiency, performance, lifetime reliability, and resource utilization.

    "abstractText": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    This research proposal will develop the knowledge required to create capsules with liquid core and polymers shells, in which the liquid core is pure, and the properties of the shell can be fine-tuned for a desired application. Capsules are used in a broad range of technologies including those for medicine, food science, energy discovery, textiles and the like. The fundamental issue that the proposed research will address is how to localize precursors to the polymer shell (monomers and initiators) such that the shell is grown around the liquid droplet, essentially shrink wrapping it. To this end, emulsions will be used as a platform for capsule formation, with droplets of one liquid in a continuous phase of the other (the droplet will become the core liquid). The ability to produce such capsules is important for creating new materials that meet societal needs; for example, capsules with a protective polymer shell and core of a salt hydrate solid-liquid phase change material can be used to passively manage heat, so that air conditioning does not have to be used as often. An important component to consider is that for these capsules to be used multiple times, the shell must be strong enough to prevent leakage but also impermeable so that the composition does not change. Notably, this research can be applied to different core liquids and polymer shells relevant to other applications, such as for carbon capture, pesticide delivery, or additive manufacturing, to name a few. Through this research, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in how to design and implement research; how to collect, organize, and report data; and how to collaborate across disciplines.     PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY    This proposal addresses the critical need to understand how confinement of initiators and monomers in emulsions impacts the production of capsules and their properties. Limitations to an interfacial polymerization approach are that the liquid core is contaminated and that only a few polymer chemistries can be used, thus restricting composition and performance-related properties such as permeability. To overcome this, the proposed research will (i) use modified particles as both surfactant and initiator for radical polymerization of monomers located in the emulsion continuous phase; and (ii) leverage double emulsions in which the interphase contains monomers to polymerize around the inner droplet. For this purpose, the interface is defined as the zone where two domains touch and the interphase as a self-contained region between two domains (thus flanked by two interfaces).These two distinct approaches are supported by initial results from the PI\u2019s lab and will provide unprecedented control of capsule composition (both shell and core) such that structure-property-application relationships can be defined.  The PI has access to all resources and infrastructure required to complete this work, and the research component is complemented by the training and professional development of undergraduate and graduate student researchers, as well as development of a hands-on module to be incorporated into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum.

    "abstractText": "Biological sex influences normal physiology and the manifestation of disease. Severe illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers can exhibit profound sex differences in their occurrence, progression, and response to treatment. Historically, the research models used in preclinical science to develop new drugs do not sufficiently account for sex differences. For example, lab experiments testing new drug compounds typically do not examine effects in both female (XX sex chromosomes) and male (XY sex chromosomes) cells. This is due in part to the absence of distinct methods for culturing female and male cells with the right combination of sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone. This CAREER project will explore research and development of sex-based human cell culture methods and engineered tissue models.  The research will be integrated with university education and K-12 outreach that emphasizes the roles of individual biological differences such as age, sex and genetic background in health and disease, thereby helping students connect with medical science research. Principles of sex-based biology and medicine will be integrated in undergraduate and graduate physiology curricula in biomedical engineering. Completion of the proposed research will deliver female and male culture medium formulations with defined sex hormone compositions and engineered tissue models for studying sex differences in the retina, skin, and other organs. Collectively, these broadly adoptable innovations may facilitate the development of sex-based medicines that can improve clinical outcomes.     Completion of the proposed CAREER activities will deliver validated sex-specific human cell culture methods and microphysiological models of the microvasculature that serve as venues for investigating: (i) sex-specific cellular physiology, (ii) sexual dimorphisms in disease, and (iii) sex-specific pharmacology. Female (XX) and male (XY) media formulations with defined sex hormone compositions (mixtures of estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, and progesterone) will be validated by benchmarking transcriptomic profiles against published datasets from biopsied endothelial cells of both sexes (XX and XY). Focusing on effects in endothelial cells of multiple sources will elucidate the interplay between sex hormone effects and tissue-specific phenotypes. Benchmarked sex-specific states in culture will be correlated with functional outputs in microphysiological systems assays of angiogenesis and vascular permeability, processes that are central to homeostasis and pathophysiology of most organs. These systems and methods will be applied to define sex differences in VEGF-mediated endothelial activation and inhibition by glucocorticoids, as paradigms of physiological regulation and pharmacologic response, respectively. The foundational scientific knowledge and new methodologies for sex-based culture methods resulting from this research can increase the clinical impact of human cell-based models of numerous diseases.

    "abstractText": "Half of all modern medicines are directly derived from or inspired by molecules found in nature, with many of these bioactive natural products produced by plants as defense mechanisms. These mechanisms can be either physical in nature, such as thorns, or chemical, such as anthranilates, with the type of mechanism varying based on the plant. Citrus, grapes, maize, alfalfa, and strawberries produce anthranilates, a group of under-investigated, secondary metabolites that have been demonstrated to deter herbivores and decrease microbial infections in plants. The goal of this research is to understand how plants produce, and recognize and interact with anthranilates in plants, insects, and mammals. Findings from this research may benefit society by advancing our understanding of plant defense against herbivores and pathogens, which has implications in reducing crop losses by predation and infection, respectively. This project further supports the U.S. bioeconomy by providing high-quality research experiences to undergraduates and post-baccalaureate researchers. This work integrates into an investigative undergraduate Pharmacology lab course that introduces students to authentic research on bioactive plant metabolites. The project also fosters public engagement through an annual collaboration with fifth-grade classes in Berkshire County, Massachusetts and Bennington County, Vermont called \u201cMaking Sense of Plant Scents,\u201d which is a multi-week, hands-on field experiment on the bird-deterrent effects of anthranilates.     Plant chemical defenses are typically secondary or specialized metabolites that are synthesized from primary metabolites, such as amino acids. While all plants synthesize anthranilate as an intermediate in tryptophan biosynthesis, several plants have co-opted anthranilate for defense metabolism. The O-methyl ester of anthranilate is an anti-herbivory volatile responsible for grape aroma that is emitted by grapes, citrus, and maize. Citrus also synthesizes N-methyl anthranilate esters that have analgesic activity in mammals. This project explores anthranilates across multiple levels: from the molecular level, to between plants, to plant-herbivore interactions. The goals of this project are to identify the molecular determinants of anthranilate ester biosynthesis, engineer plant perception of volatile anthranilates emitted from neighboring plants, and provide a systems-level understanding of the targets of anthranilates in plants and animals. Aim 1 connects protein structure to function to identify the enzymes responsible for synthesizing anthranilate esters with a focus on bioactive N-methyl anthranilates in citrus. Aim 2 examines the substrate specificity of plant methylesterases, which informs our ability to predict which plants can sense volatile anthranilates and may enable volatile perception engineering. Aim 3 sheds light on the biological functions of anthranilates in both plants and animals using chemoproteomics to identify the protein targets of anthranilates. Anthranilate esters are an under-investigated area of plant metabolism that is ripe for molecular investigation, and this research expands our fundamental knowledge of the roles of anthranilates in plant defense metabolism in agriculturally relevant plants.

Data analytics finds application across many fields and has enabled major breakthroughs, however the potential has been constrained by challenges in sharing sensitive, distributed data. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) provides a promising solution, allowing multiple parties who have relevant datasets to perform computations on their combined data while preserving privacy. As a special case of MPC, private set intersection (PSI), which securely computes the data elements in common in the private sets, has shown early success in practice. This project expands the initial success of PSI to a much broader range of applications of MPC. The project's novelties are identifying the fundamental challenges that currently limit the use cases of PSI, and developing new tools that not only enhance PSI but also address common challenges in many other MPC problems. The project's broader significance and importance are accelerating the industrial adoption of PSI and extending the frontiers of practical MPC, enabling large-scale, privacy-preserving data analytics on sensitive data. The project includes educational and outreach activities such as integrating research into curricula, organizing mentoring workshops, developing tutorial resources to guide researchers and developers in the field, and mentoring students at all levels, especially those from underrepresented groups in computing.    The project focuses on three main thrusts. First, the project bridges the gap between standard PSI and PSI with enriched functionalities by developing unified frameworks for private join and compute that computes arbitrary functions on the intersection and for fuzzy-matching PSI that identifies fuzzy or noisy matches. Second, the investigator studies large-scale PSI for big data, designing efficient protocols for PSI with unbalanced sets and resources and for streaming data, which are better suited for many real-world scenarios.

    "abstractText": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems can take advantage of complex patterns hidden within vast pools of data to make inferences about the world. However, modern systems are too large and complex to manually analyze, and come with little to no guarantees on how they work. A key challenge that remains is how to explain the reasoning behind an AI system, and answer the question: why did a model make a prediction? Such explanations are necessary for doctors and scientists to trust AI systems in high-stakes applications. However, existing explanations can result in highly misleading conclusions, resulting in injury and harm when deployed in downstream applications. This project aims to bridge the gap from formal verification to explainability, to create a new paradigm of explanations with provable assurances that can be relied upon in practice. The project's novelties are formal specifications for explanability, a verification framework for certifying explanations, and a class of AI systems with certified explanations. The project's impacts are heightened trust in AI systems when deployed, trusted scientific discovery, and translation of trustworthy AI to scientific domains. The outcomes of this project are being integrated into both undergraduate and graduate courses in artificial intelligence to bolster and motivate the technical course material.    The project aims to develop certificates for AI explanations, to build trust in AI systems via formally verified guarantees. The investigator is investigating two core research thrusts. The first thrust builds a verification framework for feature attributions, including developing specifications for explanations, computing lower-bounds for verification, and estimating probabilistic certificates. The second thrust designs architectures that are well-suited for verification of explanations. These architectures differ in the varying degrees of assumed access to the base AI model being explained, including differentiable certificates for full access, explainable wrappers for gradient access, and gray-box techniques for application programming interface (API) access. The project aims to assess verified explanations in scientific domains including cosmology, surgery, and psychology to assess real-world practicality.

In the modern age of large-scale computing and \"big data\", these distributions are incredibly complex and high-dimensional. Sampling is a universal algorithmic primitive used to manipulate and understand such probability distributions. The key challenge practitioners face is designing efficient algorithms which are guaranteed to generate random samples from the correct distribution. This is a fundamental computational task which lies at the heart of a vast array of real-world applications, including the recent revolution in generative artificial intelligence, the design of algorithms which simultaneously operate on user data while protecting user privacy, the study of materials in physics and chemistry, and statistical inference in science more broadly. The goal of this project will be to develop new mathematical tools to analyze sampling algorithms used ubiquitously in practice. The project will focus on a few foundational problems in theoretical computer science which have been open for decades. The insights derived from this research will be leveraged to design new algorithms which are not only fast in practice but also come with mathematically rigorous guarantees on the quality of their output. This research will be conducted in collaboration with a graduate student and integrated into educational materials at the undergraduate and graduate levels.     Sampling is a universal algorithmic primitive for manipulating and understanding complex and high-dimensional probability distributions, with applications to materials science, statistical physics, Bayesian inference, differential privacy, fairness, generative artificial intelligence, and more. However, the fundamental challenge practitioners face is designing efficient algorithms which are guaranteed to generate random samples from the correct distribution. This project aims to develop robust mathematical techniques for analyzing Markov chains, which are algorithms ubiquitously used in practice for sampling, optimization, and inference tasks. We focus on three basic problems along the boundary between computationally tractable and intractable, each of which captures a specific barrier in the field: (1) Prove that local Markov chains like Glauber dynamics efficiently sample a uniformly random proper coloring of any graph with maximum degree d as long as q >= d+2. This 30-year-old open problem is central to understanding the worst-case complexity of sampling for general graphical models in statistical physics and machine learning. (2) Show that, in polynomial time, local Markov chains achieve optimal correlation with the ground truth in the stochastic block model of community detection. This is an important problem towards explaining the empirical efficacy of Markov chains in solving optimization and inference tasks despite failing to efficiently converge to stationarity. The insights from this direction will also provide a foothold for designing new inference algorithms which succeed when naive Markov chains fail. (3) Given that real-world instances are typically not worst-case, understanding when and how we can circumvent known NP-hardness barriers for sampling is an important endeavor. A representative average-case problem in this direction is to design an efficient algorithm which samples a uniformly random independent set in a random graph.

Neutrophil-a cells play a crucial role in clearing infections, healing wounds, and fighting disease. To perform these tasks, they must navigate complex tissues throughout the body. While the chemical signals that guide neutrophil function are well studied, how the mechanical properties of a tissue influence neutrophil function remains unclear. Understanding this relationship is important because neutrophil dysfunction is linked to diseases that also involve changes in tissue mechanics and include cancer, heart disease, fibrosis, and conditions such as aging. This research will explore how mechanical changes in the tissue affect neutrophil function at a basic level and could help us understand how these changes worsen disease outcomes. This project will also develop a basic curriculum designed to improve scientific literacy in immunology to enhance participation in public health initiatives through community-engaged outreach while improving retention and recruitment of underrepresented students in science and engineering using both real-world applications and inclusion in the curriculum development process.    The research objective of this project is to define how matrix modulus, viscoelasticity, and dynamic tissue stiffening regulate neutrophil function in inflammation while determining how these mechanical features regulate the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators in the tissue microenvironment. This will be accomplished through three research objectives. The first research objective will decouple viscoelasticity and stiffness to determine their individual role in modulating the neutrophil response. The second research objective will investigate the effect of dynamic tissue stiffening on the neutrophil response. The third research objective will identify genetic expression and secretion profiles that are altered in response to changes in mechanical properties. All objectives will use novel engineered collagen-alginate hydrogels in an inflammation-on-a-chip microfluidic device that recapitulates key features of the inflammatory microenvironment including a model blood vessel, a tunable extracellular matrix, primary human cells, and an inflammatory stimulus. Collectively, these results will establish mechanical features of the extracellular matrix as critical regulators of neutrophil function and broadly impact our understanding of innate immune cell regulation in healthy tissues and disease. Specifically, the results will provide mechanistic insight into how mechanical cues from the matrix regulate neutrophils providing targets for modulating their function in infection and disease.

    "abstractText": "Algorithms are the building blocks of modern computation that underlies much of the technology on which our society depends. In particular, the successes of modern machine learning systems rely on our ability to solve large-scale computational tasks via efficient algorithms, such as for solving optimization problems for training neural networks, and drawing random samples from probability distributions. Algorithms in practice necessarily operate via discrete iterations, by executing one operation after another. Many algorithms are inspired by the mathematics of dynamical systems, where time flows continuously, but all such derivations have been done manually, often with sophisticated and difficult specialized analysis. A general theory of how to derive algorithms from dynamics that can preserve the desired properties is missing. This project aims to close this gap by developing a rigorous way to systematically translate continuous-time dynamics into discrete-time algorithms that can automatically preserve convergence guarantees, focusing on algorithms for fundamental problems in optimization and sampling motivated by machine learning applications. The outcome of this project will benefit many fields in which computational tasks such as optimization and sampling are used, by providing researchers and practitioners a higher-level language involving dynamical systems to design and reason about algorithms. This project also provides training opportunities for students, outreach events to popularize the dynamical perspective of algorithm design, and a collaborative effort to compile a catalog of dynamics and algorithms.    This project will strengthen the matching parallel structures between dynamics and algorithms for optimization and sampling, by studying two complementary directions. In the first direction, this project studies sampling problems as optimization problems on the space of probability distributions. Many recent results in sampling have been derived from this perspective, in particular for the basic greedy methods analogous to gradient descent. This project aims to complete the translation from optimization to sampling by deriving algorithmic results for various sampling problems as inspired by the optimization results, including for constrained sampling, accelerated sampling, and sampling with stronger mixing time guarantees. This project will combine ideas and tools from dynamical systems, geometry, probability, and information theory to extract concrete algorithmic principles to design new algorithms in practice. In the second direction, this project aims to formalize the robust parallel structures between dynamics and algorithms with matching convergence guarantees. This project will study the mechanics of translating dynamics to algorithms, and investigate why certain ideas are successful in the translation, including the idea of speeding up time to achieve faster convergence rates, the optimality of accelerated methods for optimization and sampling, and the geometric structure of the space of algorithms and dynamics that allows such robust parallel structures to be exhibited.

    "abstractText": "Current and future US engineering workforce demands require research to better understand how to support the professional formation of all engineering students. The number of enrolled engineering students nation-wide had the sharpest decline in a generation. Further complicating the problem is the decreased math and reading scores across the US since the pandemic, adding an additional filter of who can enter into engineering. Projected national shortages of engineers are in the tens and hundreds of thousands of workers in some sectors. Simultaneously, fewer young people are entering into four-year degrees. Once a student has enrolled in an undergraduate engineering program, they become a valuable asset for meeting the workforce demands and need support to continue in their professional formation. However, researchers have found that some subgroups of students are at a particularly high-risk of leaving engineering. Among those subgroups of at-risk learners are nonbinary engineering students. Researchers know very little about factors supporting or hindering nonbinary students engineering professional formation. This project serves to help understand how these students leverage identity-specific strengths from their communities, known as community cultural wealth, to succeed in their academic careers. This novel, transformational EAGER proposal will explore their community cultural wealth\u2014that is, for example, how these students sustain hopes and goals, successfully navigate their majors, receive support from family-style relationships, leverage their social network, transgress expectations and resist negative stereotypes and microaggressions\u2014as a means to thrive in engineering. We will interview twenty nonbinary engineering students at various stages of their academic careers using narrative inquiry. Through this project, we aim to raise awareness of the unique assets of the nonbinary engineering community so that engineering students feel affirmed and heard, and engineering educators may design inclusive education practices and advocate on behalf of the nonbinary community in engineering. This project outcomes will result in the development of resources that can be shared to support the professional formation of nonbinary students, as well as the broader engineering student population.     The purpose of this asset-based qualitative study is to investigate how nonbinary engineering students leverage their community cultural wealth to support their wellbeing, belonging, and persistence during their professional formation. We are guided by two research questions: 1) How do nonbinary engineering students access community cultural wealth within engineering and queer communities, and 2) how do nonbinary engineering students mobilize their cultural capital to support their wellbeing, sense of belonging and persistence? We will interview 20 engineering students at various stages of their professional formation using composite narrative inquiry and critical incident technique. By interviewing students at various stages of professional formation, we will explore how capital is accrued and how different forms of capital impact students\u2019 persistence at differing stages of their identity development. Our findings will generate new knowledge about how nonbinary students draw upon their personal assets and those of the LGBTQ+ and ally communities during their professional formation. Nonbinary participants will benefit from being heard, affirmed, and seen throughout the interview process, and from reading the narratives of other nonbinary engineering students leveraging their assets to persist, belong and thrive in engineering. To reach students outside of the study, we will disseminate the composite narratives to LGBTQ+ STEM focused social media and professional organizations.

    "abstractText": "Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia is an emerging process with significant importance in alleviating nitrate contamination in water and producing ammonia with less energy. The key to effective nitrate reduction lies in designing stable, efficient, and highly selective catalysts. Recently, high entropy alloys have been attracting growing attention for catalytic systems thanks to their remarkable stability in diverse environments, and tunable surface microstructures that allow the fine modulation of the adsorption, activation, and desorption of reaction intermediates. However, the investigation of using high entropy alloys for the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia is still in an early stage, and this project aims to answer the question of how to identify the ideal compositional configurations of high entropy alloys for nitrate adsorption with optimal binding strength. The research activities contribute to the enrichment of campus engineering education in various disciplines, such as density functional theory calculations, machine learning, wastewater treatment, electrochemistry, and nanotechnology. This project also provides a platform for outreach activities, where students can perform hands-on experiments and develop their interests in science and engineering.      This project aims to design a computational framework that integrates density functional theory calculations and machine learning algorithms to effectively explore the multidimensional space of high entropy alloys and actively identify optimal structural compositions for nitrate adsorption with desired binding strength, such that complex nitrate reduction reactions can be completed more effectively and selectively to produce ammonia sustainably. The research outcome advances the fundamental understanding of nitrate reduction to ammonia using high entropy alloys from several different aspects, such as (1) the interactions of nitrate molecules with diverse surface microstructures and (2) the relationships among structure, property, and catalytic performance, which facilitate the catalyst design for the industrial implementation of nitrate conversion to ammonia through electrochemical reduction, and alleviate the energy consumption for both the wastewater treatment and ammonia production sectors.

    "abstractText": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant funds research, education, and outreach activities aimed at developing new methods to understand and forecast the behavior of complex biological systems using data-driven approaches. Observing biological processes directly, such as genetic circuits and neuron activities, is often restricted by the limited capabilities of current experimental technologies. Nonetheless, dynamic systems theory offers mathematical principles that make it possible to glean significant information about these biological processes from limited data sets. The research activities funded by this award intend to create a new analytical framework that merges artificial intelligence with foundational concepts from nonlinear dynamics theory to develop principled algorithms for interpretable modeling of biological time series data. These algorithms use topological methods to overcome noise and errors in data, along with generative machine learning, an emerging approach that utilizes large data sets to construct probabilistic models that can predict future states. These data-driven techniques will be applied to study animal behavior and neuron activity, identifying recurring patterns associated with common behaviors such as navigation. Additionally, this CAREER award supports educational activities that will engage high school students in mathematical research, making complex mathematical concepts more accessible through scientific visualization. Furthermore, it will contribute to the creation of an open-source, online textbook on computational physics and engineering, bridging traditional computational methods with contemporary artificial intelligence techniques to advance science in the digital age.    A central challenge in systems biology is inferring unseen dynamical systems from limited observations, such as measurements from a small number of genes, neurons, or species. This research introduces a generative machine learning algorithm that maps biological time series to a network of discrete dynamical motifs, that is, estimates of invariant solutions of the unknown dynamical system that governs a biological process. This approach requires no prior knowledge of the governing equations, instead leveraging strong theoretical constraints to enhance accuracy. Initially, topological data analysis is used to detect evidence of these invariant solutions directly from biological time series. This technique is integrated within an end-to-end generative machine learning architecture that maps complex time series to coarse-grained dynamic processes. This method will be applied to large-scale recordings of organismal behavior, addressing challenges posed by low-dimensional and highly heterogeneous measurements that vary widely across different organisms. By mapping various datasets of organismal behavior onto a shared space of latent orbits, this research will demonstrate how nonlinear dynamics can uncover conserved biological motifs across the tree of life.

    "abstractText": "This Level 2 Institutional and Community Transformation project aims to serve the national interest by establishing networked improvement communities (NICs, scientific learning communities with a common aim) among STEM Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and the faculty members who provide GTAs' teaching professional development (Providers). In undergraduate STEM education, research has shown methods that engage students, such as active learning, can be equitable and effective. However, using active learning strategies equitably and effectively requires guidance and structure. This project strives to generate a support structure that helps GTAs implement evidence-based teaching practices with a focus on active learning by having experienced GTAs provide peer-mentoring for their less experienced peers. To equip and support the peer mentors, the project intends to develop, test, and refine a peer-mentor curriculum, facilitated by Providers and tailored to each STEM discipline. This project aims to establish and sustain two critical communities: (1) a STEM GTA NIC using peer-mentoring and (2) a STEM Provider NIC that will facilitate discipline-specific peer-mentoring. The research team will endeavor to identify how the GTA NIC and the Provider NIC become established by capturing the longitudinal changes in GTA teaching professional development via the theory of change known as Improvement Science that looks for incremental cycles of growth. This project is important because it will focus on a key undergraduate STEM teaching workforce (GTAs) by establishing a network of Providers to serve as critical agents of change for undergraduate STEM education by directly impacting GTAs' teaching. This project is significant because it can support sustainable and transformative changes in teaching undergraduate STEM courses through multiple departments using the Provider NIC.    This project plans to implement a peer-mentor program across multiple STEM disciplines (biology, chemistry, communication, mathematics, physics, psychology, and statistics) at the University of South Carolina (USC) and Bowling Green State University (BGSU) to grow GTAs' equitable use of active learning strategies and improve GTA teaching professional development. The rationale for using peer-mentoring comes from nine years of prior research and funding of sustainable peer-mentor programs established within mathematics departments to improve the equitable use of active learning. In this program, experienced GTAs are educated in a semester-long seminar about how to mentor novice GTAs. GTA Mentors (1) regularly observe novice GTAs and provide individual formative feedback, and (2) facilitate small GTA group discussions about teaching with AL. This model, initially funded externally, has now been internally funded and enculturated at both universities\u2019 mathematics departments. The overarching goal of the current project is to establish peer-mentoring within other STEM disciplines with support from two new multidisciplinary NICs, one for Providers and one for GTAs. To this end, the project's three goals are to: (1) construct a network of peer-mentoring GTA teaching professional development programs in STEM departments at two universities; (2) adapt a program for each Provider to implement peer mentoring in their STEM department; and (3) revise and evaluate the effectiveness of the peer-mentor program across universities and departments using Improvement Science's Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. Through this process, changes can be tracked, researched, and justified with a manageable scope. The main research questions this project aims to explore are (1) How do individual Providers and GTAs develop and measure the effectiveness of instruction as a part of establishing the peer-mentor program? and (2) How have the NICs transformed GTA teaching professional development through peer-mentoring with active learning? The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.

    "abstractText": "The ease of use afforded by software user interfaces (UIs) has expanded access to computing and driven the digitization of modern society. More aspects of daily life rely on software than at any point in human history, which necessitates the construction of well-designed UIs that allow end-users to easily carry out computing tasks. However, many modern UIs contain defects that make using the underlying software difficult or confusing, leading to wasted time and money for our computing-dependent society. One reason that bugs persist in UI-centric programs is that the process of building, testing, and maintaining high-quality software UIs, a process we refer to as UI Engineering, has long been documented to be uniquely challenging for software engineers. The difficulties in this process stem from the need to reason between the higher-level abstraction of a program UI, and the lower-level implementation details of program features. To address this fundamental challenge, this project will develop UI-specific machine learning techniques that will bridge the abstraction gap between UI and code and serve as the backbone of a set of developer-focused approaches that will improve activities related to UI engineering. The key premise that guides this project, which is supported by prior work, is that the tasks afforded by UIs are encoded into their visual pixel-based representations, and that these representations can be effectively learned by multimodal machine learning techniques. The results of this project will allow software engineers to carry out UI Engineering tasks related to documentation, testing, and debugging more effectively, leading to construction of higher-quality UIs with fewer defects. Organizations and society will benefit from software systems with higher-quality UIs that better support the seamless completion of a range of computing tasks, leading to lower costs in software development, testing, and maintenance. This project also aims to educate the next generation of software engineers by providing them with the knowledge and tools needed to construct high-quality UIs. The project will create reusable educational course content, integrate findings and tools resulting from the research into computer science curricula, and organize community building and outreach events.     This project is centered around four goals. First, it will design and develop a new form of multimodal screen embedding that can capture the relationships of UI components, aiding in effective automated learning of UI semantics. Second, it will design and develop a set of novel automated multi-modal software documentation techniques that learn from both existing code and UI data to summarize code as it relates to app features. Third, it will design and develop approaches for automated repair of UI-related bugs by leveraging the relationship between faults that manifest through the UI and the patterns of corresponding patches. Fourth, it will design and develop an approach for agentic exploration of UI-centric apps using reinforcement learning. The proposed research will generate foundational knowledge related to designing natural language processing, computer vision, and program analysis techniques for automated understanding of UI screens, explore the potential of leveraging patterns in UIs to automate software engineering tasks, and develop new forms of UI-centric developer tools.

    "abstractText": "Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships among objects of various forms. They consist of a collection of \"vertices\" (the objects) and \"edges\" (the connections) which connect pairs of vertices. Graphs can model a wide range of applications such as connections in social networks, hyperlinks in the web, and the wiring of the brain. Many of these graphs are massive. The availability of such large-scale graphs has posed significant challenges in terms of storage, processing, and analysis. At their heart, these tasks require efficient algorithms for various problems defined over graphs. While designing such graph algorithms has been a cornerstone of computer science research for decades, traditional algorithms often fall short when scaling to massive data. For instance, algorithms designed for massive graphs cannot even afford to read the entire input -- an assumption that is crucial for most traditional algorithms. This project focuses instead on advancing \"sublinear-time\" graph algorithms, which are specifically designed to process massive inputs. These are algorithms that uncover meaningful information about their entire input by examining only a small portion of it. The research objectives of this project will be complemented by a comprehensive approach to broadening the outreach of sublinear time algorithms through exploring practical applications, educational initiatives, dissemination efforts, and expanding participation in algorithmic research.     More concretely, this project focuses on three aspects of sublinear time graph algorithms: their foundations, their limitations, and the connections they have to other models of computation. Specifically, this project aims to develop more efficient and ideally optimal sublinear time algorithms for a variety of foundational graph problems such as maximum matching or various graph connectivity problems (such as minimum spanning trees). The investigator also aims to develop a better understanding of the limitations of sublinear-time graph algorithms by designing systematic approaches to prove (unconditional) query lower bounds for these problems. Finally, many of the recent developments in other models of computation such as dynamic, parallel, or streaming algorithms rely heavily on better sublinear time graph algorithms. This project aims to take concrete steps towards better understanding these connections and further developing them.

    "abstractText": "Rivers occasionally experience a process called avulsion when they jump out of their banks and carve a new path across the landscape. The resulting floods are more extreme than typical floods caused by rainfall; avulsions can devastate entire communities. River avulsions occur infrequently, so we have very few observations of them. As a result, the scientific understanding of this important natural hazard lags behind other comparable hazards like earthquakes. For example, the number of people in the United States living in the potential path of river avulsions is not known because we do not even know for sure what conditions prime rivers to avulse. In this project, the team will develop a new unified theory for the processes that prime river avulsion, and test the theory using experiments and observations from satellite images.     Two main conditions are thought to destabilize rivers and set them up to avulse. The first is called superelevation (\u03b2), where sediment accumulates on the levees and the riverbed, lifting the river above the surrounding floodplain. The second is called gradient advantage (\u03b3), where a steeper alternative path is available to the river. These two conditions have long been considered either mutually exclusive or unrelated. Recent observations have revealed that avulsions occur when the combined values of superelevation and gradient advantage reach a joint threshold; specifically, where \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b3 \u2248 2. Based on this, the team will test three hypotheses: 1) the joint threshold for river avulsion arises because alluvial ridge superelevation grows faster on fans and gradient advantage grows faster on deltas; 2) avulsions occur in isolated river reaches where \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b3 is locally elevated, and do not occur elsewhere; and 3) the threshold of \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b3 for avulsion will decrease with increasing trigger size. To build on this discovery, the project team will develop a new theory for river avulsion setup into a physics-based modeling framework that seeks to model how \u03b2 and \u03b3 evolve over time on a given river. That model will be tested against new remote-sensing observations of how \u03b2 and \u03b3 vary along river reaches, and new lab experiments aimed at testing the controls on the threshold value of \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b3.

    "abstractText": "This project aims to improve the practice of verifying probabilistic programs. Probabilistic programs are a way of capturing randomized behavior using the same kinds of structures we use for regular programming. This kind of randomness is a key component of many machine learning algorithms, so probabilistic programs are an important tool for building safer, more robust machine learning systems. However, techniques for verifying that probabilistic programs behave safely are under-studied compared to traditional deterministic programs. This project's novelties are improved tools for verification of probabilistic programs, allowing more properties to be verified for a larger set of programs. This project's impacts are improved safety and reliability for systems which include probabilistic programs and ultimately for systems with machine learning components. The project will support student learning by providing the undergraduate students working in the project with high-demand skills such as software verification.    Concretely, this project builds on the framework of abstract interpretation, an existing methodology for verifying traditional programs. While there has been some work in extending abstract interpretation to probabilistic programs, that work has various drawbacks making it infeasible for analyzing complex programs. This project will develop novel abstract domains for verifying programs with complex, continuous probability distributions modeled by traditional programming constructs. Such problems arise naturally in (for example) continuous control settings. The project aims to equip these domains with the order-theoretic operators required to handle programs with unbounded loops.

The resulting floods are more extreme than typical floods caused by rainfall; avulsions can devastate entire communities. River avulsions occur infrequently, so we have very few observations of them. As a result, the scientific understanding of this important natural hazard lags behind other comparable hazards like earthquakes. For example, the number of people in the United States living in the potential path of river avulsions is not known because we do not even know for sure what conditions prime rivers to avulse. In this project, the team will develop a new unified theory for the processes that prime river avulsion, and test the theory using experiments and observations from satellite images.     Two main conditions are thought to destabilize rivers and set them up to avulse. The first is called superelevation (\u03b2), where sediment accumulates on the levees and the riverbed, lifting the river above the surrounding floodplain. The second is called gradient advantage (\u03b3), where a steeper alternative path is available to the river. These two conditions have long been considered either mutually exclusive or unrelated. Recent observations have revealed that avulsions occur when the combined values of superelevation and gradient advantage reach a joint threshold; specifically, where \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b3 \u2248 2. Based on this, the team will test three hypotheses: 1) the joint threshold for river avulsion arises because alluvial ridge superelevation grows faster on fans and gradient advantage grows faster on deltas; 2) avulsions occur in isolated river reaches where \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b3 is locally elevated, and do not occur elsewhere; and 3) the threshold of \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b3 for avulsion will decrease with increasing trigger size. To build on this discovery, the project team will develop a new theory for river avulsion setup into a physics-based modeling framework that seeks to model how \u03b2 and \u03b3 evolve over time on a given river. That model will be tested against new remote-sensing observations of how \u03b2 and \u03b3 vary along river reaches, and new lab experiments aimed at testing the controls on the threshold value of \u03b2 \u2022 \u03b3.

    "abstractText": "Due to the vast amounts of data and the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, there is an increasing demand for programs that can fully leverage the power of High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. This project aims to develop a framework capable of automatically rewriting programs to run more efficiently on modern multicore and manycore architectures. The project\u2019s novelties are its ability to gain a deeper understanding of complex programs by employing advanced machine learning techniques and ensuring the optimized program aligns with its intended functionality. By analyzing the syntax and structural design of programs, the proposed framework identifies tasks that can be executed in parallel, significantly improving performance and speed. This enables developers to identify optimization opportunities. As programs are transformed to become faster and more efficient, maintaining reliability is paramount. The framework validates that optimized versions produce results consistent with the original, ensuring trustworthiness, particularly in critical domains like scientific computing. The project's impacts are streamlining the scientific software development process, creating faster, more reliable, and purpose-driven programs, and supporting the growing demands of modern computing platforms and technologies.    This project introduces a comprehensive framework for improving program performance and reliability by integrating advanced methods in program analysis, parallelization, and validation. The presented framework aims to both identify and generate parallel versions of sequential code. By employing a graph-based multimodal contrastive learning approach, it combines two views of a program: its graph representation using low level virtual machine (LLVM) intermediate representation based graphs and its textual representation from the original source code. Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), the framework uniquely learns intrinsic parallel characteristics. It directly generates parallelized code, eliminating the need for additional data structures or manual annotations. To support parallelization and ensure robust code transformations, this project also focuses on understanding the underlying computations of a program. By leveraging neural architectures, it analyzes and classifies data flow graphs to comprehend program characteristics and generates extensive program variants to train the model. This method enhances the precision of detecting program clones and obfuscated transformations, which is crucial for identifying computational equivalence and guiding optimization decisions. Finally, the project also addresses the challenge of verifying the correctness of complex program transformations, particularly those involving reduction parallelization patterns. The reduction pattern, which leverages algebraic properties like associativity and commutativity, often results in transformations that cannot be directly validated using existing equivalence-checking methods. This module develops new polyhedral validation techniques to handle combinations of reduction parallelization and classical loop transformations (e.g., tiling, skewing, unrolling), ensuring the correctness and reliability of transformed programs. The project aims to advance the state of the art in automatic parallelization, program understanding, and transformation validation, providing a robust framework for optimizing and verifying modern software systems.

    "abstractText": "Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) technology provides access to immersive 3D spaces with applications in education, workforce training, social interaction, and remote collaboration. This emerging technology often uses eye-tracking devices that measure where a user is looking to support interaction and reduce cybersickness. However, this tracked gaze data presents privacy risks because gaze data has the potential to identify users from their eye movements or make inferences about private information, such as age, gender, and ethnicity. This proposal's goal is to mitigate privacy and security risks that arise from the use of eye tracking even when the VR/AR headset prevents malicious applications from having direct access to the gaze data. In particular, the project explores new methods to manipulate VR/AR rendering in a way that exposes personal eye-tracking data to applications that might misuse the data. The project team will measure the vulnerabilities that exist in current rendering systems and develop corresponding defense mechanisms that protect eye-tracking data for VR/AR users in personal, enterprise, and high-risk applications.    This project will investigate security vulnerabilities and novel threats in the form of side-channel attacks on foveated systems, which use gaze data to optimize VR/AR systems operating under compute and power constraints. The project team will create a testbed of standardized foveated rendering algorithms and VR attack surfaces and use it to evaluate the ability of malicious developers to integrate side-channel attacks that impact GPU usage and performance in a controlled manner. A set of attack algorithms will be applied to the performance metrics to reconstruct gaze positions and evaluate the ability to infer private information about a user. The dataset and methods will be made public to help inform VR platforms of existing security risks and advance the development of system-level defense mechanisms to detect and mitigate the risk of side-channel attacks on foveated VR systems. Finally, the scope of side-channel attacks will be broadened to include AR optimizations that are hardware-specific and not standardized like the foveated rendering pipelines of VR systems. The project will establish a standard benchmark for foveated side-channel attacks and provide defense mechanisms to protect eye-tracking data in VR/AR systems.

    "abstractText": "This Level 2 Institutional and Community Transformation project aims to serve the national interest by establishing networked improvement communities (NICs, scientific learning communities with a common aim) among STEM Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and the faculty members who provide GTAs' teaching professional development (Providers). In undergraduate STEM education, research has shown methods that engage students, such as active learning, can be equitable and effective. However, using active learning strategies equitably and effectively requires guidance and structure. This project strives to generate a support structure that helps GTAs implement evidence-based teaching practices with a focus on active learning by having experienced GTAs provide peer-mentoring for their less experienced peers. To equip and support the peer mentors, the project intends to develop, test, and refine a peer-mentor curriculum, facilitated by Providers and tailored to each STEM discipline. This project aims to establish and sustain two critical communities: (1) a STEM GTA NIC using peer-mentoring and (2) a STEM Provider NIC that will facilitate discipline-specific peer-mentoring. The research team will endeavor to identify how the GTA NIC and the Provider NIC become established by capturing the longitudinal changes in GTA teaching professional development via the theory of change known as Improvement Science that looks for incremental cycles of growth. This project is important because it will focus on a key undergraduate STEM teaching workforce (GTAs) by establishing a network of Providers to serve as critical agents of change for undergraduate STEM education by directly impacting GTAs' teaching. This project is significant because it can support sustainable and transformative changes in teaching undergraduate STEM courses through multiple departments using the Provider NIC.    This project plans to implement a peer-mentor program across multiple STEM disciplines (biology, chemistry, communication, mathematics, physics, psychology, and statistics) at the University of South Carolina (USC) and Bowling Green State University (BGSU) to grow GTAs' equitable use of active learning strategies and improve GTA teaching professional development. The rationale for using peer-mentoring comes from nine years of prior research and funding of sustainable peer-mentor programs established within mathematics departments to improve the equitable use of active learning. In this program, experienced GTAs are educated in a semester-long seminar about how to mentor novice GTAs. GTA Mentors (1) regularly observe novice GTAs and provide individual formative feedback, and (2) facilitate small GTA group discussions about teaching with AL. This model, initially funded externally, has now been internally funded and enculturated at both universities\u2019 mathematics departments. The overarching goal of the current project is to establish peer-mentoring within other STEM disciplines with support from two new multidisciplinary NICs, one for Providers and one for GTAs. To this end, the project's three goals are to: (1) construct a network of peer-mentoring GTA teaching professional development programs in STEM departments at two universities; (2) adapt a program for each Provider to implement peer mentoring in their STEM department; and (3) revise and evaluate the effectiveness of the peer-mentor program across universities and departments using Improvement Science's Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. Through this process, changes can be tracked, researched, and justified with a manageable scope. The main research questions this project aims to explore are (1) How do individual Providers and GTAs develop and measure the effectiveness of instruction as a part of establishing the peer-mentor program? and (2) How have the NICs transformed GTA teaching professional development through peer-mentoring with active learning? The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.

    "abstractText": "Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads demand computing systems with large silicon areas to sustain throughput and performance. However, manufacturing costs, yield limitations at advanced tech nodes, and die sizes reaching the reticle limit restrain us from achieving this on a monolithic die. With the recent innovations in advanced packaging technologies, disaggregated chiplet-based architectures have opened the next frontier of innovation in AI hardware and System on Chips (SoCs). However, the scope of stacking multiple chiplet tiers in 3D, various package interconnect options, and thermal challenges introduce significant design challenges. The project\u2019s key novelties are developing AI/Machine Learning(ML)-assisted System and Package-level co-design methodologies that can optimize the power, performance, chip area, reliability, and cost of the next-generation AI hardware. The project's broader significance and importance include: (1) Generate knowledge and scientific methods to optimize the system-level architecture of multi-tier chiplet-based designs, and thus contribute to the advancement of the field of AI hardware and AI. (2) Develop educational resources and open-source tools for designing next-generation chiplet-based hardware in advanced packaging. (3) Cultivate a pipeline of skilled engineers and scientists with expertise in computer systems and AI/ML, and to promote participation from undergraduates, underrepresented groups, and K-12 students.       In Thrust 1, using the first principles, the key performance metrics of chiplet-based AI hardware are analytically modeled. Heuristics and deep learning (e.g., Reinforcement Learning) based methods are explored to find the set of optimal parameters (e.g., chiplet area and count, number of tiers, packaging interconnects, etc.). Thrust 2 focuses on yield, reliability, and power integrity. Hardware and software-level comprehensive techniques are developed to detect and repair faulty Hybrid Bonds (HB) to achieve maximum yield at the package level.   To ensure robust power integrity of the multi-tier chiplet system at optimum energy efficiency, the emerging technique of backside power delivery is explored. As heat dissipation is a major impediment to the widespread adoption of multi-tier chiplet stacking technology, Thrust 3 explores a proactive thermal management technique and workload scheduling algorithm to prevent simultaneous peak temperatures in adjacent chiplets in a stack.  Overall, the collective advancement of these research thrusts will establish a comprehensive scientific methodology for the design of multi-tier 3D SoCs.

    "abstractText": "Communities worldwide rely on water resources from mountain snowpacks. Because of this, snow hydrology research in recent years has used a variety of techniques to model and observe snowmelt processes. However, a disconnect between observed physical processes and modeling capabilities has been revealed, exposing a need to improve understanding of snowmelt dynamics. This research will fill a knowledge gap in understanding how the snowpack stores and transmits liquid water to streams. This project will develop a snowmelt monitoring program for both research and educational opportunities. Scientific advancements will be made while also providing experiential learning opportunities for both university and K-12 students across Wyoming, including Native American populations in the Wind River Reservation. In total, two Ph.D. students and one M.S. student will be involved in scientific research while approximately 20 undergraduate students, 300 high school students, and 1,250 middle school students will gain a broad understanding of hydrologic sciences through outreach and field activities. Through field observations and modeling, this project will identify when and where common model representations of snowmelt processes need to be improved. The results will be broadly applicable rather than specific to individual watersheds for the purpose of improving future streamflow forecasting models to benefit stakeholders across the United States and beyond.     The overall scope of this NSF CAREER project is to improve fundamental knowledge of the hydro-terrestrial system in headwater catchments and produce transformational understanding of hydrologic fluxes within a snowpack. This project will test a model structure that includes representation of previously observed liquid water dynamics in a snowpack that are not currently included in models. Thus, the overarching goals of this proposal are to: 1) Develop a long-term monitoring program to define a snowpack\u2019s role in storing and transmitting liquid water to streams under various conditions; and 2) develop a long-term educational program that promotes mountain hydrology across the University of Wyoming campus and STEM education to underrepresented groups. This project will use a combination of traditional hydrology field work, geophysical observations of a melting snowpack, and advanced modeling techniques to conduct investigations. The results of this work will identify when and where consideration of the snowpack as an \u201cextension of the vadose zone\u201d is important for hydrologic modeling based on watershed characteristics while providing unique experiential learning opportunities for students at the University of Wyoming and beyond.

    "abstractText": "Organizations and individuals outsource sensitive data from their own local systems to remote cloud services, making encryption necessary to maintain the privacy and security of the sensitive data. However, to preserve the usefulness of the outsourced data, the goal is to encrypt it so that users can still ask questions about their data without ever decrypting it on the cloud's premises. Current end-to-end encrypted system approaches aimed at addressing this goal have converged to two extremes. In one case, the approaches leak (i.e., reveal) some information about the encrypted data records that are processed in answering a query, which gives a false sense of security since leaks may enable reconstruction of the underlying sensitive information by sophisticated adversaries. In the other extreme, approaches do not reveal any information about the processed data, which requires significantly more computation and makes the overall performance too slow for practical use. The project's novelties are introducing a new paradigm for encrypted systems with carefully constructed, fine-grained leakage that is (1) scalable for practical use and (2) provides rigorous guarantees of protection against the reconstruction adversaries. The project's broader significance and importance are in influencing practical designs and industry practices to create a safer deployment of encrypted systems. The project aims to enhance education by integrating security modules into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum, introducing interdisciplinary courses, broadening student engagement, and expanding pilot programs with local high schools.    This  project introduces encrypted systems with fine-grained leakage and focuses on three interconnected areas: The first explores how specific query and update patterns can nullify leakage, providing provable guarantees of inapproximability or inability to reconstruct against adversarial reconstructions. The second thrust develops cryptographic designs for structured encryption, enabling context-informed leakage profiles that dynamically increase adversarial uncertainty. The third thrust applies this paradigm to concrete real-world scenarios. The research team plans to share project results with industry collaborators.

    "abstractText": "Expert engineering practitioners frequently rely on their intuition \u2013 the ability to subconsciously use their past experiences to navigate a present problem. Practitioners report intuition to be a crucial problem-solving skill that they are also hesitant to admit having used because of stigma associated with the term. Alternative terms like \u201cgut feeling,\u201d \u201cspidey-sense,\u201d or even \u201cblack magic sorcery\u201d are often used instead. This avoidance around discussing intuition use denies a reality of engineering practice and may also explain why engineering intuition remains understudied. Limited previous work has identified that intuition is primarily developed through past experiences. It is yet unknown how personal and professional experiences influence intuition development and how positive or negative feedback loops created by experience influence intuition use. All that can be deduced is that intuition\u2019s reliance on experience inherently means that the ability to develop this critical problem-solving skill is opportunity-limited, and the value of certain experiences in engineering is reinforced throughout hiring processes that favor students with internship, research, and leadership experiences. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to support the creation of the 21st century engineer (aligning with the goals of Engineering Education and Centers Division). This work will shed light on the experience-intuition-expertise relationship in engineering to further our understanding and to take steps towards creating space for open discussion of intuition use in engineering. The knowledge generated will support the creation of curricular interventions that explicitly embed experience-based skills development and serve as a step towards alleviating the opportunity bottleneck surrounding intuition development. Generated knowledge will also expand our understanding of what experiences add value in developing transferable engineering problem-solving skills. These insights will subsequently support the hiring and recruitment practices that allow for consideration of qualified candidates with non-traditional experiences, which will reduce the barriers to entry, persistence, and re-entry into engineering careers.     This CAREER project will employ a qualitative approach across two Aims. Aim 1 intends to characterize the ways in which engineering practitioners understand experience to influence intuition development and use. A phenomenographic approach (that is, one which explores the ways in which people experience or think about phenomena) will be used to address RQ1: How do practitioners understand the role of experience in their development of engineering problem-solving skills, particularly the skill of engineering intuition? This step will be followed by narrative analysis addressing RQ2: How do personally formative experiences facilitate or inhibit an individual\u2019s perceived agency in using intuition as a problem-solving approach?, and RQ3: How do aspects of identity and self-perception interplay with experience to affect an individual\u2019s development and use of intuition? Outcomes will directly inform the first component of the project\u2019s Education Plan to develop and pilot a student-facing Practitioner Voices Series that uses practitioner narratives to highlight different experiential pathways. Aim 2 intends to characterize the perceptions of intuition and its role in engineering practice held by engineering faculty and industry recruiters. A phenomenographic approach will also be used to answer RQ4: How do engineering faculty and industry recruiters understand engineering problem solving, particularly the role of intuition? This step will be followed by discourse analysis used to answer RQ5: What does the discourse around intuition across different groups reveal about sociocultural influences on the construct and the potential challenges of any intuition-related initiatives? Outcomes will provide insight into the target audiences for the second component of the project\u2019s Education Plan to develop and pilot materials, including short courses, that introduce intuition to engineering faculty, practitioners, and industry recruiters. These efforts have the potential to revolutionize engineering by facilitating a more diverse workforce poised to more efficiently and accurately leverage their past experiences to address current and arising world problems.

This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries. Volcanic hotspots, like Hawai\u2019i and Cape Verde, are areas where hot rock from deep inside the Earth rises to the surface. This hot rock melts in the shallow part of the Earth's mantle to create magma, which then travels through the ocean floor and erupts to form volcanoes. Scientists don't fully understand how this rising magma interacts with the ocean floor or how it might change the Earth's crust as it moves upwards. This is hard to study because these processes happen deep underground\u2014inside the volcano\u2014and can only be inferred using indirect methods. The Cape Verde Islands offer a unique opportunity to study these processes directly. The islands have been lifted up several kilometers above sea level and eroded, exposing the deep volcanic layers inside. This makes it possible for researchers to study the volcanic systems, including the oceanic crust and sediments upon which the volcanoes are built. The scientists funded in this proposal will map and sample the interior of a volcano on Maio Island in Cape Verde to see how magma from the hotspot interacts with the ocean crust and seafloor sediments on its way to the surface. The samples will be tested for their chemical makeup, isotopic compositions, and ages. This research will help answer an important question in geology that continues to puzzle geoscientists: whether or not the ascending magma is modified by the process of assimilating seafloor sediments. The study will also explore how the oceanic crust and sediments are pushed upward by magma as it intrudes pervasively into the crust, which may be a key part of how Cape Verde volcanoes form, inflate, and uplift by several kilometers. A team of researchers from the US and the UK will work together on this project, with a graduate student from the University of California, Santa Barbara, who will gain valuable experience in fieldwork, chemical analysis, and mass spectrometry. These skills are critical to US national defense, as some of the US research team\u2019s former students now work in nuclear forensics at Los Alamos National Labs. The project will not only help geoscientists better understand how volcanoes work, which is an important benefit to society due to hazards posed by volcanoes, but also provide important insights into the formation of critical mineral resources. Additionally, the US and UK researchers will collaborate with local scientists from Cape Verde, and share their findings through local Cape Verdean media, helping to strengthen the relationship between the US, UK, and Cape Verde.      Volcanic hotspots, such as those in Hawai\u2019i and Cape Verde, are sourced by upwelling plumes originating from deep within the mantle. Before erupting as ocean island basalts (OIB), the mantle melts rise and interact with the oceanic lithosphere. Plume melting ceases when the rising plume reaches the base of the lithosphere. OIB melts then continue to ascend through the lithospheric mantle until they break through the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) crust by diking. These melts eventually migrate upwards through the seafloor sediments that cover the MORB basement. Despite advances in understanding, our knowledge of melt-lithosphere interaction during this process remains limited, primarily due to the inaccessibility of the deep regions where it occurs. Thus, instead of direct observation, the community relies on indirect evidence and chemical proxies to infer processes operating deep inside the lithosphere. Fortunately, the Cape Verde Islands offer a unique opportunity to study the deep structure of an oceanic hotspot volcano that, together with remnants of the underlying Mesozoic MORB crust and a 1-km-thick sequence of marine sediments, have been uplifted several km and exposed at the surface. By conducting detailed fieldwork, collecting samples, and analyzing them with geochemical and 40Ar/39Ar methods, this project aims to test broad questions: First, as upwelling OIB dikes and sills transit through 1 km of seafloor sediment, do they assimilate it? Second, is the dramatic island uplift in Cape Verde caused by cumulative intrusions and is the abundance of OIB dikes crosscutting the exposed MORB basement consistent with this? Third, can the record low 187Os/188Os observed in the world\u2019s ocean basins\u2014previously identified by laser ablation ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) in sulfides hosted in Cape Verdean peridotite xenoliths\u2014be reproduced by Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry, thereby confirming subcontinental lithospheric mantle under Cape Verde? This project will involve international collaboration across different scientific disciplines, with two principal investigators (PIs) bringing complementary expertise: PI Jackson (UC Santa Barbara) specializes in global OIB geochemistry, while PI Ramalho (Cardiff University, UK) focuses on Cape Verde\u2019s geology and volcanic evolution. The proposal will also fund a UCSB graduate student and a Cardiff postdoc, offering them a unique interdisciplinary experience in a cross-disciplinary environment. The PIs will collaborate with colleagues from Cape Verde's Instituto Nacional de Gest\u00e3o do Territ\u00f3rio (INGT) to produce new geological maps for the study areas, and will support an INGT professional to participate in the fieldwork and mapping efforts and co-author a publication. Together, the PI team plans to submit a proposal to designate the studied outcrops as a protected Geoheritage site, recognizing their global significance. Finally, the PI team will share their findings with the Cape Verdean public through newspapers, radio, and social media channels.

The main scientific goal of this conference is to bring the experts in Poisson geometry, Lie theory and their applications to the study of symmetry, as well as nearby domains, together to present the significant recent developments in each area, and discuss the open problems and challenges in each field, and create a forum for researchers to interact and collaborate. Such a unique week-long conference will help to identify and promote promising new research directions, and to immerse graduate students and junior researchers in the most current research in the fields.    Poisson geometry and Lie theory are related branches of differential geometry, which are both rooted deeply in mathematical formulation of classical and quantum mechanics, and the study of symmetry in physics. In the last 50 years, these areas experienced a golden period of accelerated growth with many milestone results, e.g. solutions of the Arnold conjecture, mathematical aspects of the mirror symmetry, Kontsevich\u2019s formality theorem, etc. This conference provides a platform for researchers from these areas and nearby domains to learn the most recent advances in Poisson geometry, Lie theory and symmetry, to identify promising new directions, and to help bring graduate students and postdocs up to speed with the current frontier of the fields.

    "abstractText": "Companies, governmental entities, and the general population are increasingly adopting autonomous driving vehicles, often called self-driving cars, to support their everyday activities. This research project aims to reduce the safety-critical errors that may occur in the software that powers such vehicles. Specifically, this project will produce techniques to efficiently and effectively detect and remove defects in autonomous vehicle software through simulations, which can result in immense savings of capital, time, and effort by reducing the need to conduct similar testing and quality assurance in the physical world. Through collaborators in the autonomous driving system (ADS) industry, the proposed testing and debugging techniques will be designed to ease the transition of the developed technology into industry. The project will also produce teaching modules on ADS testing and debugging at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels, helping students to develop skills necessary in the workforce of a transforming auto industry. Specific plans aim at broadening participation in computing by organizing quarterly programs to students from underrepresented populations in community colleges, providing them with opportunities to learn about and conduct research on testing ADSes and helping them for transferring to four-year colleges.     To tackle the aforementioned challenges in testing and debugging ADSes, this project will develop methods focusing on several key areas. First, it will produce techniques that automatically generate driving scenarios that are likely to reveal errors when the ADS is responsible for a traffic violation, especially in the case of collisions. Second, this project will produce mechanisms that accurately and efficiently consider the context of the driving scenario and the precedence of traffic laws and guidelines to identify ADS defects. Third, this project will produce techniques to determine whether a collision an ADS is involved in is avoidable and, thus, defective through the transfer of collision scenarios across combinations of ADSes and simulators. Fourth, this project will use machine learning to predict if the ADS can avoid a collision, reducing the need for costly testing in simulation. Fifth, this project aims to cover as much of the ADS code as possible by generating tests that target untested parts of the code. Sixth, this project will extract deterministic module-level tests from non-deterministic system-level tests to further increase testing and debugging efficiency, aiding engineers in finding faulty code in ADSes.

    "abstractText": "In software engineering, date and time are fundamental concepts. Whether it is scheduling flights, processing bank transactions, computing payroll wages, validating digital certificates, controlling industrial processes, or logging operational data\u2014software relies heavily on making accurate calculations related to dates and times. However, code related to date and time calculations is often also a source of human error, due to the inherent complexity of concepts such as calendars, time zones, and daylight savings, as well as the wide variety of textual representations and international conventions used across different industries. Moreover, most software makes use of third-party components, called libraries, for providing functionality related to date and time. Errors in any of these components can potentially impact the reliability of a huge number of software systems which depend on their correctness for day-to-day operations. This project aims to first systematically study past software bugs related to date and time computation by analyzing source code repositories, and then, to develop techniques for automatically uncovering new date and time related errors that may be present in existing software. Successful completion of this project will improve software systems that our society critically relies on against a pervasive class of errors. The research project will also result in materials that will be incorporated in software engineering courses. At the same time, the project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students and students from underrepresented groups in computing.    Consistently performing date/time computations accurately is challenging due to: (i) fundamental complexities with the domain such as dealing with leap years, time zones, daylight savings, clock drifts, diverse data representations and string formats, etc.; and (ii) the heterogeneous landscape of date/time interfaces across different programming languages and third-party libraries, which all provide similar functionality but use subtly different representations, conventions, and default behavior. This project aims to strengthen the correctness of date and time computations performed in software systems via: (i) a systematic study of date/time-related issues in open-source repositories; (ii) the development of static and dynamic program analysis techniques to uncover date and time bugs in open-source date/time libraries, as well as client software that makes use of such libraries; and (ii) enhancing support for formal reasoning of date-based constraints in theorem provers.

    "abstractText": "Some of the challenges associated with wearable technologies are the limitation on computational power, battery capacity, data privacy, user interface design, and the need for seamless integration into user lifestyles without causing discomfort. These challenges limit the on-device implementation of machine learning methods, which are suitable for classifying and estimating medical conditions based on the biomarkers sensed by the wearable devices. This research addresses these problems by developing a scheme that distributes the computational load of machine-learning models across wearable devices. Results from this research contribute to deploying advanced health monitoring tools for in-home care of frail populations, such as post-COVID patients. This is aligned with the NSF mission to promote the progress of science and advance national health. The development of this project involves multidisciplinary efforts from computer science, bioengineering, and electrical engineering, as well as educational activities with the participation of students from underrepresented groups.    This project focuses on developing a wearable sensor network scheme with distributed and interconnected computing capabilities. As an application case, the wearable computing sensor network is aimed at biomechanics analysis for frail populations. The research plan is geared toward creating an advanced scheme of wearable devices to improve power consumption, data privacy, and computational performance for advanced health monitoring and analysis. To fulfill the strict requirements of size, computational load, and energy consumption, a novel distributed machine learning architecture is designed and deployed on each wearable sensor using field programmable gate arrays. The deployed architecture is a simplified version of the parallel-computing architecture found in commercial graphics processing units, which have been demonstrated to be suitable for machine-learning applications. In addition, this architecture contains additional hardware components for estimating missing data, synchronization, and addressing communication errors between the devices. This project addresses realistic challenges in biomedical and wearable technologies research, including (i) segmenting and training machine learning models considering the nature of biomechanical data and wearable inertial sensors without affecting accuracy, (ii) modeling a lightweight computer architecture for performing distributed machine learning inference in real time, (iii) estimating detailed body motion dynamics using a reduced amount of inertial sensors, and (iv) integrating reliable and state-of-the-art data analytics environments for efficient real-time analysis and visualization. The education plan tackles three major areas: (i) research training and competitive experiences for graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of computer science, computer architecture, and health-related areas, (ii) course development in topics related to edge computing, real-time systems, and machine learning applications to healthcare, and (iii) outreach to K-12 students and professionals by the introduction of competitive activities.

    "abstractText": "Within the cellular environment proteins and polysaccharides (complex sugars) interact with each other in very crowded environments and sometimes form a separate liquid phase.  The goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of those interactions and their biological consequences in plants.  The work could have implications for our understanding of that could include cell wall expansion, pollen formation and plant survival under stress. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms of protein-polysaccharide interactions and their phase separation, the findings will inform strategies to improve crop resilience, addressing challenges in agriculture and contributing to food security. In addition to its scientific contributions, this project will inspire the next generation of scientists by providing students with hands-on training in advanced scattering techniques, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and promoting inclusive STEM education. By integrating cutting-edge research with educational initiatives, the project aims to enhance workforce development and expand the adoption of advanced biophysical methods in both academia and industry, ensuring broader societal impacts.      This project will systematically investigate the phase behavior of proteins and polysaccharides in crowded environments that mimic the biological settings where these interactions predominantly occur. The research focuses on understanding how crowding impacts the interactions, dynamics, and conformational behavior of these biomacromolecules. Using small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS), combined with complementary techniques such as calorimetry, fluorescence imaging, and electron microscopy, this project will characterize molecular-level interactions and identify the mechanisms driving phase separation. The project will simulate crowded environments using macromolecular crowding agents with diverse physical and chemical properties to explore how these agents influence both segregative and associative phase separation. By examining the structural and dynamic properties of protein-polysaccharide complexes, the study aims to uncover the fundamental principles governing phase behavior and establish predictive models for biomacromolecular interactions in biologically relevant conditions.

    "abstractText": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY     This award supports theoretical research on antiferromagnets, where no net magnetization shows up even when the material has an ordered underlying magnetic structure. Such hidden magnetic orders typically respond to external stimuli ~1,000 times faster than those in regular magnets, making them an intriguing candidate for future information processing devices with ultrafast response speed and low power consumption. One major challenge of such efforts is to identify the detection and manipulation methods of the hidden, compensated spin order using means that are available in a typical device setup. With the support of this CAREER award, the PI and their research team will address this issue by integrating the frontier developments of computational methods and quantum theory, enabling robust predictions and in-depth understanding of material behaviors under various perturbations, including electric currents, applied voltages and laser pulses. The outcomes of this project may enable new memory and computing technologies that are much faster than the conventional ones, whereas the corresponding power consumption can be dramatically reduced. Once achieved, these new technologies may create new opportunities in many digital solutions that are essential to our everyday life, including smartphones, personal computers, data centers and artificial intelligence services.    This award also supports efforts contributing to the development of US STEM workforce through a series of new educational and extracurricular outreach efforts. Particularly, the award will support (i) the PI\u2019s new topological physics course at Georgetown University for both undergraduate and graduate students; (ii) new lectures and interactive displays in USA Science and Engineering Festival at Washington DC; and (iii) new videos communicating the frontier developments of topological materials to the general public.     TECHNICAL SUMMARY    This award supports theoretical research on the transport and optical responses of antiferromagnets using density-functional theory, dynamic mean-field theory and Keldysh nonequilibrium Green\u2019s functions. These investigations will generate the understanding of the linear response of antiferromagnets in the forms of bulk, thin films and devices of mesoscopic scales, particularly focusing on the transport and optical behaviors due to the lifted Kramers degeneracy. Activities supported by this award include (i) establishing the quasiparticle tight-binding models in antiferromagnets considering the electron-disorder interaction within the dynamic mean-field theory; (ii) creating a new numerical method that can adaptively and robustly resolve the topological and geometric features of the quasiparticle spectra; and (iii) investigation of the coherent transport of the quasiparticles in a tunnel junction setup, focusing on tunneling resistance and the spin torque. Outcomes of these activities will be integrated into a new open-domain package `QuantumGeom\u2019, containing the new numerical methods that are useful for the research of general topological materials.

    "abstractText": "This project will significantly contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists and mathematicians by supporting the graduation of high-achieving, low-income undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need at Georgia Southern University. A public institution of higher education, Georgia Southern enrolls approximately 22,000 students a year and offers science and mathematics undergraduate degrees in the College of Science and Mathematics. Over 5 years, this Track 2 project will provide four years of scholarships to 36 unique full-time or part-time students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, geosciences, mathematics, physics, or sustainability science. The project aims to increase student persistence in STEM fields by linking scholarships with holistic, effective support activities including one-on-one faculty mentoring, undergraduate research experiences, a first-year STEM summer bridge program, a specialized STEM curriculum, and a seminar series on academic excellence, career preparedness, and well-being. With the help of a dedicated faculty mentor, each student scholar will create a tailored Student Success Plan outlining the steps needed to achieve career goals. This project has the potential to broaden access, participation, and success in STEM fields as well as inform the public on how mentoring and individual development plans support retention and graduation of this student population.     The two goals of this project are i) to increase the number of undergraduate student participants who attain STEM degrees and progress into STEM fields and ii) to increase the understanding of how the aspects of scholarship support, faculty mentorship, and project programming contribute to the first goal. In the United States, earning a STEM degree and securing subsequent employment positions continues to present obstacles for many students. Specific to Georgia Southern University's College of Science and Mathematics, the retention rate of low-income students declines each year with a loss of 29% after the first year and a 4-year graduation rate of only 39%. Factors such as lack of role models, multi-dimensional mentorship (including intellectual, personal, emotional, financial), professional support, and personal or family's and friends' negative educational experiences have all generally been demonstrated to affect students' persistence in STEM. However, the combined effects of scholarships, one-on-one mentoring, research experiences, tailored curriculum, as well as academic, career, and well-being programming on student success in STEM fields need closer evaluation. The project's main research question is \"To what degree do components of this project including scholarships, faculty mentoring, undergraduate research experience, and cohort and professional development activities improve the retention and graduation of student participants as well as job placement post-graduation?\" This project will investigate the impact of these resources on student success in increasing both the student yearly retention and 4-year graduation rates for all participants to at least 70%. This project will be evaluated using a mixed methods approach using information from student surveys and an exit interview, data collected from Student Success Plans, as well as retention, graduation, and job placement rates. The results of this project will be made available as presentations at research conferences and in publications in STEM journals. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented, low-income students who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.

    "abstractText": "While science fairs can support engagement in STEM learning and promote STEM career exploration, students from economically disadvantaged and racially diverse communities in the Tulsa, Oklahoma region often face barriers to their participation. Specifically, students from both Tulsa Public Schools (a diverse urban school district) and small districts located in Creek County, OK (a rural county in the region) are typically underrepresented at the Tulsa Regional Science Fair, with most participants coming primarily from suburban school districts and small private schools in the Tulsa metro. This project will build the STEM education research capacity of the principal investigator to examine barriers to science fair participation among underrepresented students in the Tulsa region as well as explore how informal learning opportunities connected to the science fair can inspire long-term interest in science and engineering for all participants. In particular, this project seeks to understand how participation in a science fair impacts student engagement and interest in STEM, and how targeted outreach activities affect participation rates in the Tulsa Regional Science Fair across different student groups. Outreach activities will focus on students from school districts that have been underrepresented in recent years at the science fair, particularly urban and rural schools in Tulsa and Creek Counties in Northeast Oklahoma. The project will develop outreach events and tools to give students experience with simple, hands-on research activities, including using technology-rich AI-supported tools to identify research topics for a science fair project. Project outcomes will provide valuable insights into how such programs can build confidence, expand educational opportunities, and strengthen the STEM workforce. The project also includes professional development activities for the principal investigator to help build a stronger STEM education research community in the region.    The primary goals of this research project are to (1) investigate the motivational and structural barriers to participation in the Tulsa Regional Science Fair, and (2) to design and study the impact of outreach interventions, primarily in informal STEM learning contexts, that address the barriers to science fair participation among students from economically disadvantaged and racially diverse communities in the Tulsa, Oklahoma region. Through research and professional development activities, the principal investigator will draw on social cognitive career theory, peer mentoring theory, and self-determination theory to explore how aspects of student agency correlate with participation and engagement in the science fair and outreach activities and how different project interventions impact student motivation, self-efficacy, and agency in STEM learning among underrepresented groups. Additionally, the PI will investigate how technology-rich tools (specifically Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Model-derived resources) help students identify and develop science fair project topics, and how these tools shape student experiences participating in the Tulsa Regional Science Fair. A grounded theoretical approach will provide a framework for data collection and analysis, as well as focus the professional development activities of the PI towards building capacity in conducting STEM education research. An advisory board of STEM education research and outreach experts will mentor and support the PI in assessment, design, educational theory, and data collection methods. The findings associated with this work will be shared through publications, conference presentations, and regional dissemination efforts.

    "abstractText": "Most computers generate random-looking numbers without using any randomness at all; instead, the numbers are generated by a mathematical sequence that appears random. This might not be random enough for every application. Pseudorandomness, a key idea in theoretical computer science, involves constructing mathematical objects that exhibit random-like behavior while being created in a predictable way. These objects are essential for solving problems where true randomness is computationally costly or impractical to generate. The project addresses challenges such as developing efficient algorithms to determine whether complex mathematical expressions simplify to zero, a critical question in areas like algorithm design and circuit complexity. It also explores connections to error-correcting codes, which ensure reliable communication and data storage by correcting transmission errors. By advancing knowledge in these areas, the project contributes to foundational methods in computation and communication systems while supporting the national interest through fundamental research. The project also includes educational initiatives to create resources and courses that inspire the next generation of scholars in mathematics and computer science.     The work spans computational complexity and coding theory, unified under the theme of algebraic pseudorandomness. In complexity theory, the project focuses on deterministic methods for polynomial identity testing in special classes of arithmetic circuits, addressing a central problem in derandomization. It also applies algebraic geometry to study structural properties of algebraic varieties that arise in computational problems, offering new perspectives in complexity theory. On the coding theory side, the research examines the combinatorial and algebraic properties of error-correcting codes, particularly list-decodable and list-recoverable codes, with the goal of developing more efficient constructions and improving their theoretical guarantees.

    "abstractText": "NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY    This award supports research, education, and outreach activities focused on understanding materials properties driven by the coupling between electrons and the vibrations of atom lattices in solids. This electron-lattice vibration interaction is fundamental to many phenomena, such as electric heating in transistors, light absorption and energy conversion in solar cells, and superconductivity where electric current is conducted with zero loss. The theoretical understanding of these phenomena can be simplified by considering electrons as independent of each other and considering their coupling to the lattice vibrations individually. However, in many topical materials of technological significance, electrons interact strongly among themselves while also collectively coupled to the lattice vibrations. Such strong interaction and coupling leads to exotic quantum phenomena, but it also presents challenges in achieving a clear understanding of the behaviors of such materials.     This project addresses these challenges by developing and applying advanced quantum-mechanical computational approaches and large-scale simulation techniques. The goal of this research is to reveal the actual role of electron-lattice vibration coupling in interacting-electron materials systems and to explain intricate phenomena observed in novel superconductors and semiconductors.     This project supports the education of a graduate student. Additionally, the project integrates research, community building, education, and outreach activities, by targeting a wide range of researchers, from high-school students to undergraduate students, to graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. The PI will provide summer internship positions for high-school and undergraduate students and design appropriate research training projects. This project will also support various tutorial workshops to promote advanced computational methods for the young generations and foster collaborations in the scientific community.    TECHNICAL SUMMARY    This award supports research, education, and outreach activities focused on studying the interaction between phonons and many-body correlated electrons, and the role of electron-phonon coupling in driving exotic phases in and out of equilibrium. The understanding remains elusive largely due to the lack of appropriate ab initio methodologies that treat electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions at the many-body level simultaneously. This project will use newly developed many-body approaches, namely GW perturbation theory and time-dependent adiabatic GW with phonons (where G represents the single-particle Green function and W is the screened Coulomb interaction), to (i) address the role of phonons in unconventional and novel superconductors, and (ii) investigate many-body self-energy effects and nonequilibrium dynamics in phonon-assisted optical phenomena in semiconductors. This project will push forward the ab initio electron-phonon coupling computation into the many-electron level and the nonequilibrium regime, vastly expanding the application scope of many-body perturbation theory to phonon-relevant phenomena.    This project integrates research, community building, education, and outreach activities to expose a broad range of generations of students and researchers to various computational and theoretical techniques and scientific advancements. This project will promote novel electron-phonon coupling computational approaches through pilot workshops and foster coherent collaborations among software developers and users. The PI will provide summer internship positions for high-school and undergraduate students via designed outreach and education activities to introduce frontier materials and physics research progress, and to prepare young generations to pursue future careers in science and engineering.

    "abstractText": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    This award supports research aimed at improving our understanding of heterogeneous molecular motion in glassy materials, using theory and computer simulations. When liquids freeze, their component molecules' motion is reduced to tiny oscillations around quasi-permanent preferred positions. In many cases, these preferred positions form a crystal, i.e. a geometrically regular array where they are separated by equal distances and they form well defined angles that are the same everywhere. Alternatively, if crystallization does not occur, a glass is formed. In a glass, the geometrical arrangement of the molecules is not regular but amorphous; the molecules appear to have \"frozen in place\" in the positions they had in the liquid.  Glassy materials include window glass (mostly composed of silica), most plastics (glasses made of organic long chain molecules), obsidian (a rock formed by rapid cooling of volcanic lava), and many others. Recent research has shown that also biological tissues display glass-like behavior.     One puzzling aspect of materials in the midst of the transition to the glassy state is \"heterogeneous dynamics\", i.e. the fact that at a fixed temperature, and even though the composition of the material is homogeneous, molecular motions are heterogeneous: in some regions, the molecules flow slower than in others, and over time regions spontaneously exchange their behavior from fast to slow and vice versa. Heterogeneous dynamics leads to surprising behaviors in the properties of glass-forming materials associated with particle motion. This makes it very important in applications of glassy materials, both for their industrial processing, and for predicting the behavior of those materials once deployed in applications. Dynamical heterogeneity is also present in suspensions such as mayonnaise, jelly, and many biological materials (where the particles are liquid drops instead of molecules) and granular materials such as sand, cement, and any powder-form material (where the particles are solid grains). Understanding and predicting dynamical heterogeneity is thus very important in a large number of scientific, medical, engineering and industrial contexts.    The supported research addresses the problem of heterogeneous dynamics and attempts to predict and quantify it by using a theoretical model called the Fluctuating Relaxation Rate Model. This model leads to a set of new quantities that can be measured both in experiments and in numerical simulations. As part of this research, the relation between heterogeneous molecular motions of different kinds, such as translations and rotations, will also be studied. In more general terms, the approach pursued in this research aims to provide a new, more transparent language to distill experimental and numerical measurements of dynamic heterogeneity into a common form, and to use those new results to start creating a classification of the possible types of heterogeneous dynamic behaviors in glass-forming liquids.    In terms of broader impacts: among 88 Ohio counties, Athens County's 2022 per capita income ranked 84th, and more than half of the schools in the county are rated 2 of 5 stars by the Ohio Department of Education. This project includes a collaboration with a local school to create and run a computer programming club for 6th graders, and a yearly Summer workshop for local teachers, aimed at fostering similar initiatives in other schools. These activities will increase the chance that local children pursue STEM careers, and help improve the planning, communication, mentoring, and teaching skills of the undergrad and graduate student researchers that will be leading the programming club.      TECHNICAL SUMMARY    The glass transition remains one of the main unsolved problems in Condensed Matter Physics. One particularly poorly understood aspect of this transition is dynamical heterogeneity, i.e. the fact that the local relaxation time fluctuates very strongly over space and time.  This award supports research which will develop, test and explore the consequences of the Fluctuating Relaxation Rate Model, a continuum model which quantifies dynamical heterogeneity starting from two continuous variables: the local relaxation rate and the local particle density. The model will be used to propose a set of new observables that more directly probe the fluctuating relaxation rates, and numerical simulation data will be analyzed using those observables.  This approach aims to provide a physically transparent language to distill experimental and numerical measurements of dynamic heterogeneity into a common form, and to use those new observables to start creating a classification of the possible types of heterogeneous dynamics in glass-forming liquids.    Specific objectives of this research include: (i) Developing and validating a continuum model directly based on the relevant degrees of freedom for dynamical heterogeneity; (ii) Clarifying the relation between experimental and numerical measures of dynamic heterogeneity, by mapping them to correlators of the local relaxation rate. Those quantities will be studied in simulations in at least one example, a glass-forming diatomic molecule liquid; (iii) Correlating dynamical heterogeneity in translations and rotations by analyzing data from the same diatomic molecule simulations; and (iv) Start classifying glass-forming liquids by the lifetime and spatiotemporal correlations of the relaxation rate fluctuations, both in the aging and the equilibrium regime.    This project includes a collaboration with a local Athens County school to create and run a coding club for 6th graders, and a yearly Summer workshop for local teachers, aimed at fostering similar initiatives in other schools. Among 88 Ohio counties, Athens County's 2022 per capita income ranked 84th. More than half of the schools in the county are rated 2 of 5 stars by the Ohio Department of Education. These activities will increase the chance that local children pursue STEM careers, and help improve the planning, communication, mentoring, and teaching skills of the undergrad and graduate student researchers that will be leading the coding club. These activities will leverage on previous progress in the area: Ohio University Physics undergrads have already been teaching science to 6th graders in the same school. The coding club will build on that, and will use micro:bit kits that were purchased with support from ASCENT -- the Appalachian Semiconductor Education and Technical Ecosystem, led by Ohio University and funded by Intel.

The role of fires in the ecology and evolution of primates is not well understood, because most current primate species live in tropical forests where fire studies are rare. This doctoral dissertation research assesses how forest fires affect primate species that have different diets. The research provides context for studies of primate and human evolution since wildfires may have played a significant role in the transition from forest to savannah environments when hominins were first emerging. Results from this study are relevant to the assessment of current conservation efforts. Additionally, the project provides training and educational opportunities for K-12, undergraduate and graduate students.      This study assesses how forest fires affect primates with different dietary traits, by focusing on two food sources suggested to benefit primates after fires: new foliage and insects. Applying surveys and distance sampling methods, this research measures and compares the post-fire population densities of seven non-human primate species across dietary niches. The study evaluates changes in the availability and nutritional content (water, protein, fiber, and condensed tannin) of leaves from known food species in burned and adjacent unburned forest. Additionally, resource abundance and isotopic niches among sympatric species are analyzed to determine whether fire-induced changes lead to dietary overlap among them. The study informs primate conservation and primate evolution.

    "abstractText": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    The electric storage capacity of Li-ion battery technology is limited, leading to issues such as cell phones that cannot retain enough charge for a full day and electric vehicles that cannot travel for more than 300 miles before they need to be plugged in. Graphite, currently used as a lithium reservoir in Li-ion batteries, has limited storage capacity rate capabilities. Lithium is stored inside the atomic structure of graphite, which minimizes the formation of lithium metal filaments, or dendrites, that can cause the battery to short-circuit. However, if charging is done too quickly, there is insufficient time for the lithium ions to be transported into graphite, resulting in lithium accumulation on the surface of the graphite, raising safety concerns. In principle, if lithium and other alkali metals such as sodium could be directly electrodeposited onto the surface of a suitable substrate without the formation of dendrites, both the storage capacity and charging rate could improve significantly. The advantage of sodium is that it is much more earth abundant than lithium, which would significantly reduce costs. By taking advantage of analogies between electrochemical and physical vapor deposition, this research is developing transformative electrodeposition methods to enforce the evolution of atomically flat surfaces that prevent dendrite formation. This knowledge is being used to guide models that inform the design of the next generation of alkali metal batteries. The project involves a range of activities to broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in science and will introduce the next generation of materials scientists and engineers to the varied skills needed to maintain U.S. agility in battery technology. These efforts are contributing to and leveraging investments by the State of Arizona through its New Economy Initiative, which seeks to address local workforce needs and foster growth of industries through establishing the state-funded science and technology center on Advanced Materials, Processes and Energy Devices.    TECHNICAL SUMMARY    The electrochemical deposition of virtually all metals can result in the evolution of dendrites, where growth occurs at the tip of a protrusion involving tip-splitting phenomenon. Growth of a protrusion can also occur from its base, by an extrusion process at high enough homologous temperature, as a result of compressive stresses that evolve during electrodeposition. This type of growth is called a whisker. The ambient temperature electrodeposition of both Li and Na often results in the development of dendrites and whiskers, which is the major issue in developing practical metal batteries, since this can lead to short circuiting of the batteries. The key issue this project addresses is the identification of electrochemical parameters that result in two-dimensional and atomically flat electrochemical growth of Li and Na without the development of dendrites or whiskers. This project focuses on applying concepts derived from manipulating the kinetics of thin-film growth modes in physical vapor deposition to obtain atomically flat overlayers for film-substrate systems that conventionally result in three-dimensional Volmer-Webber growth. One of the approaches used is called Defect Mediated Growth and involves the use of potential pulsing routines and specific additives in the electrolyte referred to as mediator metals. The other approach, called Surfactant Mediated Growth, involves an additive that floats on the surface of the depositing Li or Na and facilitates an interlayer exchange process promoting the development of flat electrodeposited films. Physical vapor deposition is used to identify the surfactants subsequently used in electrochemical deposition-dissolution cycling of Li and Na to obtain dendrite-free films. Kinetic models of physical vapor deposition verify the role of the surfactants in the experiments and mechanism for formation of atomically flat overlayers. The surfactant-based approach also addresses pitting during the dissolution process and how preferential deposition inside a pit can be achieved without the occurrence of dendrites.

First-year college students will receive up to 5 years of scholarship support while pursuing bachelor's degrees in biology, chemistry, engineering, physics, mathematics, and computer science. The project aims to increase student persistence by providing support socially, financially, academically and with career exploration. Evidence-based support systems will be provided within a vibrant living-learning community including a summer bridge program to enhance students' foundational math and problem-solving skills, peer and faculty mentorship, proactive supplemental instruction, a First-Year Seminar including a speaker series, shared coursework, extracurricular cohort-building events, activities to promote career exploration and readiness, internships, and undergraduate research opportunities. In addition, the project will support curriculum improvements aimed at increasing student engagement and retention within gateway STEM courses which will be shared regionally. The evaluation of project aims will generate knowledge regarding first-year retention, student engagement, academic support, and career support strategies. These important findings will improve educational practices and prepare students for numerous in-demand science, math, technology, and engineering jobs and promote social mobility for scholars.    The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of high-achieving, low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. There are four specific aims: (1) Recruit, retain, and support at least 18 students' progress toward graduation and placement in high-need STEM careers; (2) Identify which elements of the program are most influential in increasing STEM belonging, persistence, and classroom engagement; (3) Evaluate program components which prepare students for the STEM workforce; (4) Investigate and disseminate correlations between student engagement and belonging and effective teaching practices in gateway STEM courses. It is well known that student belonging in STEM, self-efficacy, and preparedness for first year STEM courses are essential for increasing persistence, graduation, and career success. However, little is known about which programmatic features increase sense of belonging, persistence, classroom engagement, and career preparation. The project will generate knowledge regarding first-year retention, student engagement, academic support, and career support strategies. A mixed methods approach will be used to determine essential program features and correlate effective teaching practices which promote engagement and belonging. The project has the potential to improve educational outcomes and STEM teaching practices. Results will be shared within a regional STEM Gateway Engagement professional development workshop and through disciplinary papers and conferences. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented low-income students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.

    "abstractText": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project supports research on understanding how compound flood mechanisms influence decision making about shoreline adaptation in multi-jurisdictional governance systems and how feedbacks from those decisions modify spatiotemporal patterns of flooding risk. Compound flooding from coastal and terrestrial sources presents a serious threat to coastal communities and is predicted to worsen in the future. Coastal managers, elected officials, and policy makers at local and regional levels are grappling with a host of issues related to reducing the impacts of flooding on people and built environment. Their decisions about how to adapt have crucial implications, and, in some cases, may lead to new patterns of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.      Despite inherent connectivity between coastal-terrestrial processes and human decision making in defining flood hazards, the feedbacks between these processes and their influence on future risk in coastal communities are not well understood. This project develops an integrated modeling framework to examine the emergent behavior that arises due to the interactions among local and regional decision makers. It also investigates the role of regional actors in forming effective flood adaptation approaches. Specific research activities include (i) a survey of stakeholders\u2019 adaptation preferences given information about flood interdependencies, (ii) development of an integrated modeling framework that couples compound flood assessment with multi-agent simulation of decision making, and (iii) evaluation of the role of multi-level actors in regional adaptation planning. The project designs and implements new educational opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in interdisciplinary coursework and research experiences related to the modeling of coupled human and natural systems. Findings from the research will increase awareness of interdependencies between flood hazards and adaptive responses among coastal managers and inform planning efforts on reducing regional flood risk.

The Barrett Lectures have been held annually since 1970 and are known as one of the oldest and most prestigious mathematics conferences in the southeastern United States. This event is expected to draw 40-50 participants and will include local and regional, national and international researchers and graduate students. One of the primary goals of the Barrett Lectures is to bring prominent researchers working in active areas to Knoxville, as a service to the southeastern region of the country as well as the national mathematics community. The conferences invite a range of mathematicians, from established experts to early career researchers and graduate students, to attack the biggest challenges in the area of mapping class groups and the newly emerged field of big mapping class groups.     The topic of the 2025 Barrett Lectures has the advantage of a broad appeal to researchers at universities throughout the country who are exploring a range of problems and techniques in the current development of geometry and dynamics of non-positively curved groups.  Participants will present and learn about breakthrough results in the area of low dimensional topology and geometric group theory, such as the first examples of purely pseudo-Anosov closed surface groups in a mapping class group. The topics covered will include large scale geometry of Teichmuller space, random walks in non-positively curved groups, surface subgroups of mapping class groups, algorithmic problems in Out(Fn) and coarse geometry of large mapping class groups.

    "abstractText": "This grant will support research that advances the understanding of hydrokinetic energy extraction from flowing rivers. While water is a widely available source of renewable energy it is typically harnessed in hydropower plants that rely on dams to create a hydrostatic head. In contrast, hydrokinetic power generation is minimally disruptive to the environment. Despite the significant potential, with 1433 terawatt-hours per year of hydrokinetic power potentially available from U.S. rivers, only about 8% of this energy can be captured by current Hydrokinetic Energy Conversion devices. This is due to a minimum flow speed requirement of 4 knots, while flow speeds in U.S. rivers typically do not exceed 2 knots. The research intends to develop a new approach to hydrokinetic energy conversion that works for low-flow conditions by drawing on expertise in nonlinear vibration, fluid dynamics, and energy harvesting. The project's impacts are to enhance scientific knowledge in these fields while promoting economic and societal benefits in the U.S. by tapping into the vast renewable energy potential of rivers. Through integrated outreach, education, and research activities, the project will actively involve graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students from underrepresented groups. To broaden the impact, the research will include field testing in the Red Cedar River at Michigan State University, providing hands-on experience for students and raising public awareness of hydrokinetic energy through live demonstrations.    A promising trend in hydrokinetic energy research is the use of flow-induced instabilities, such as flutter, which can improve scalability and energy conversion efficiency in typical river flow speeds. However, existing technologies have seen limited success. In current systems, energy is harvested through circuits that introduce electrical damping, but increasing damping raises the critical flow velocity at which instabilities occur. While damping is necessary for energy extraction, its stabilizing effect undermines the process. The goal of this research is to develop a novel approach to hydrokinetic energy harvesting, leveraging the destabilizing effect of damping to capture energy from low-velocity flows and sustain flutter oscillations. The research team intends to design a new power take-off unit that uses piecewise-constant damping and inertia parameters to enhance energy harvesting efficiency and extend the operational flow speed range. They will also develop a unified framework for analyzing flutter instability and post-flutter behavior in the presence of parameter discontinuities. Currently, experimental evidence of the destabilizing effect of damping in energy harvesting is lacking. To fill this gap, the researchers will take a systematic approach to address the complex fluid-structure interaction by first studying a two-link fluid-conveying pipe in a water tank, then testing a two-link system in a controlled laboratory water tunnel and ultimately conducting experiments in a river. The river test will provide insights into flutter behavior under unsteady flow conditions and help refine adaptive control strategies for damping, ultimately reproducing the destabilizing effects observed in constant flow settings.

    "abstractText": "The ubiquity of cameras and other sensors in our environment coupled with advances in computer vision and machine learning has enabled several novel situation awareness applications combining sensing, processing, and actuation. Many of these applications are latency sensitive, network bandwidth hungry, and geo-distributed. Edge computing has emerged as a new trend in catering to these computational needs by moving computers physically near the sensors, and is driven in part by low-cost processing resources such as Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano. In the 5G/6G evolution, cell phone companies are moving network-level packet processing to geo-distributed edge data centers to amortize the computational cost of the proliferation of the wirelessly connected devices. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) (which allows users to run code without managing server infrastructure) is an appropriate allocation paradigm to increase the utilization of resource-constrained Edge sites that host such applications, but to date its design has targeted Cloud datacenters. The project\u2019s novelty rests in addressing the gap that exists in efficient system support for FaaS for a geo-distributed Edge ecosystem.  The project\u2019s broader significance and importance rest on the assertion that Edge computing could well be the next wave of disruption due to the emerging influence of AI and ML pervading all walks of future human endeavor.  Thus, the technology nuggets from this project could spur such disruption in the technology landscape.    The project is an end-to-end software system architecture for latency-sensitive situation awareness applications using the FaaS paradigm on geo-distributed Edge infrastructure.  Specifically, the project makes the following advances to the state-of-the-art: programming idioms and associated runtime machinery that ensure the spatial and temporal correctness of the applications deployed on the Edge infrastructure without requiring distributed systems expertise which is largely unavailable to most developers; software control plane techniques for efficient federated orchestration across the Edge infrastructure while preserving the application\u2019s service level objectives (SLOs) and ensuring spatio-temporal application correctness; data plane techniques for the efficient management of application state at each Edge site with respect to spatial and temporal correctness; and nimble execution environments to quickly launch application components while conserving limited Edge resources.

To overcome these limitations, this project develops intelligent error control for the progressive data management framework on multi-tier storage systems. The effort advances next-generation data reduction and management techniques for advanced cyberinfrastructures, benefiting scientific users and expediting discoveries.

In addition, the grant also provides funds for the 51st and 52nd editions of the conference which are planned for March or April of 2026 and 2027.   The ANYSRGMC is the longest running graduate mathematics conference in the country and is organized primarily by graduate students.  The conference presents an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and surrounding regions to come together, share current research, and interact with other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career. Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future mathematicians. Unlike other graduate student mathematics conferences in the region, at the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an opportunity to present their research. In many cases this is the first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk. In addition, given the broad range of topics covered, graduate students are exposed to areas of mathematics that they are less familiar with, potentially broadening their research horizons. NSF funding increases access to this conference, giving graduate students with fewer financial resources an opportunity to travel to the conference.    The majority of the ANYSRGMC consists of 30-minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions. There are also two invited guest speakers who give keynote addresses. The two speakers are typically prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate student participants. In addition to hearing interesting mathematics, students can meet and learn from successful mathematicians outside of their home universities. Breaks between the talks give graduate students a chance to interact with each other, potentially leading to new collaborations.

At the high school level, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) reported that the math scores of U.S. students in 2022 ranked 28th among 37 participating countries, posing substantial risk to the nation\u2019s competitiveness in STEM fields. This occurs while educators\u2019 burnout and attrition is at an all time high. Such significant learning deficiencies in math will cost an estimated $1.1T in GDP due to the loss of workforce productivity and innovation. Meanwhile, available tools and innovations for high school math are drastically low, in comparison to tools available for their K-8 counterparts. In response, this STTR project will develop a web-based system providing highly efficient, personalized, formative assessments that are easily customizable by teachers themselves. By addressing critical classroom and market needs, the project will help improve student math learning, cultivate a competitive and diverse STEM workforce, and contribute to high-tech innovation in a Federal Opportunity Zone in the heart of Midwest.    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a web-based formative assessment system providing highly efficient and personalized assessments that are easily customizable by teachers themselves, empowering teachers to do their work more effectively and efficiently. Unlike traditional adaptive assessment systems that often reduce the teacher\u2019s role, this platform leverages cognitive diagnostic modeling to identify students\u2019 strengths and weaknesses in high school math in real time, both individually and collectively. An innovative machine learning algorithm clusters students for targeted instruction based on their mathematical competencies and current understanding, while also tracking their progress to enable timely interventions. Teachers can regularly and flexibly regroup students based on updated assessments, ensuring that instruction remains tailored to each class\u2019s needs. Additionally, advancements in large language models (LLMs) will be utilized to expand the item bank, supporting the platform\u2019s scalability and meeting ongoing assessment demands in diverse classroom environments.

    "abstractText": "Subduction zones occur at convergent plate boundaries where one tectonic plate slides underneath another, which is one of the most essential expressions of Earth dynamics. Subduction zones host some of the world's most hazardous and intense seismic and volcanic activity. When an oceanic plate sinks under another plate in the subduction zone, large amounts of fluids are released. At depth, the fluids interact with the surrounding rocks, which also affects the generation of earthquakes and volcanoes. Subduction zone fluids also influence how critical elements cycle between the Earth\u2019s crust and mantle. This project investigates the sources of subduction zone fluids, the scale of fluid migration, and fluid interactions with surrounding rocks in the deeper sections of subduction zones. This work also aims to understand how deep fluid-rock interactions are correlated to their chemical signatures and element exchanges. Educational programs of this proposal include activities for North Carolina Latino youth and K-12 Earth/Environmental Science teachers. STEM Career & Summer Enrichment Academies will engage approximately 40 K-12 Latino youth. Professional Development Workshops will include 40 teacher participants during four summers. The proposed study will lead to several educational and societal outcomes in conjunction with anticipated scientific advancements. These outcomes include training undergraduate and graduate students and enhancing museum rock collections.    The goal of this proposal is to assess whether pervasive fluid circulations in serpentine-bearing subduction complexes are restricted to limited focus areas or migrate up-dip over kilometer scales, triggering chemical alteration in the subduction interface. It also aims to test fluid sources and mixing and assess element partitioning during fluid-rock interaction. To resolve this, samples of high-pressure \u2013 low-temperature (HP-LT) vein-related rocks and metasomatized eclogites from six localities representing warm and cold subduction gradients were selected. This project involves four sequential tasks: (1) conduct a detailed petrological assessment to characterize fluid-rock interactions at depths of ~25-60 km; (2) constrain the pressure-temperature-time of key samples to reconstruct the depths and timing of fluid-rock interaction; and combine (3) whole-rock geochemistry and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic analysis, with (4) in-situ trace elements in hydrous minerals, to constrain the signatures, sources of the fluids, and element partitioning during fluid-rock interaction. This proposal includes two Educational activities: (a) broadening the participation of youth in geoscience by conducting STEM Career & Summer Enrichment Academies over two summers ( ~40 participants) for North Carolina K-12 Latino Youth in partnership with Juntos NC and the YES Resilience: SEE Solutions program, and (b) increasing NC K-12 Earth/Environmental Science content knowledge and pedagogy through a two summer professional teacher development workshop focused on curriculum materials aligned with newly adopted NC Essential Standards for Science and Next Generation Science Standards in partnership with the UNC Center for Public Engagement with Science (~40 participants).

SJSU is a minority-serving institution (MSI), an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI), and a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).  The project will also engage students from East Side Union High School District (ESUHSD), with a predominantly Hispanic population. Over its 6-year duration, this Track 2 project will fund scholarships to 30 unique full-time SJSU students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in Geology and Earth System Science. Six first-year students will receive 4-year scholarships, and 24 transfer students will receive 2-year scholarships over the duration of the program. Sixty ESUHSD students will be funded to participate in a 10-day geoscience experience program and hundreds of ESUHSD students will be introduced to Earth Science concepts through regional field trips. The project will foster student cohorts through workshops, tutoring, and mentoring to develop students' academic and personal management skills. Research and service-learning projects will increase students' belief in their capabilities, while improving their professional skill set for career readiness, and increasing students' entry into external internships and geoscience jobs.  Student-led service-learning opportunities will engage the broader community with geoscience and sustainability topics.    The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of high-achieving, low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. There are two specific aims: 1. Increase enrollment, retention, and graduation rates in two geology BS degrees at SJSU through financial aid and program activities and 2. Develop student networks and career-readiness for entry into societally relevant geoscience jobs.  This project will advance understanding of how program activities for BS students, developed in the context of social-cognitive-career theory, can be applied to enhance student outcomes in a low-income, racially diverse education setting and a complex career landscape. Students will develop portfolios to document their career and personal skills and reflect on their accomplishments to increase their belief in their abilities as geoscientists, to set expectations and goals, and to use when developing applications to geoscience internships and jobs. Student survey results, portfolio content, and academic data will be used to evaluate how financial-social-academic support has impacted academic growth, sense of belonging, resiliency, and student knowledge of and interest in societally relevant geoscience careers. Quantitative analysis of student GPAs, retention rate, graduation rates, and the proportion of students engaged in research internships and accepted to jobs or continuing education will address the effectiveness of the project activities to develop student networks and career readiness. Results will be disseminated through relevant oral and poster sessions at academic meetings, an academic paper for geoscience education, and presentations and participation in education workshops. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.

    "abstractText": "Social loss, or the death of a member of the group, is usually a stressful experience for partners, to which humans respond by increasing social efforts that strengthen social bonds. These responses are compensatory socialization mechanisms that attenuate stress, thus mitigating the negative effects of loss. This dissertation research project provides broader comparative and evolutionary context to advance our understanding of responses to social loss.  The PI assesses the behavioral and physiological responses that follow the loss of social partners in a social non-human primate species, evaluating whether social loss leads to long term consequences and comparing the physiological and behavioral responses of the study species with those observed in humans.  The study provides research, mentoring, and educational opportunities to students and the general public.     This study assesses how the loss of individuals from a community may differentially affect surviving bond and non-bond partners in a wild non-human primate species. To this end, the study integrates historic, behavioral, and physiological data. Longitudinal and newly collected social data are used to map social networks. Behavioral data is evaluated to determine whether compensatory socialization mechanisms follow conspecific loss in this species. Ultimately, analyses address how individuals that live in fission-fusion groups behaviorally compensate for the death of a social partner, and how loss affects their social networks. The longitudinal analyses assess whether loss has a long-term impact on health and well being.

    "abstractText": "With this CAREER Award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Melanie Chiu at Stony Brook University in New York is developing a new method for controlling polymer dispersity using light to mediate the chemical reactivity of polymer chain-ends.  Polymers, long chains of small molecular units called monomers, are essential and ever-present in our everyday lives, from industrially-manufactured plastics, to naturally occurring cellulose in plants and plant-derived materials, like cotton.  The material properties of such polymers, including stiffness, melting temperature, electrical conductivity, and degradation profile are often affected by the polymer\u2019s dispersity, or the uniformity of the molecular chain lengths within a given sample. Controlling polymer dispersity\u2014whether the chains are of similar or dissimilar lengths\u2014is a promising means of tailoring a polymer\u2019s physical properties without changing its molecular structure.  This research is developing a one-pot system in which the polymerization initiator is turned on or off with light.  This photo-switch results in two states: one that yields low dispersity polymers and another one that yields high dispersity polymers.  Once these polymers are made, the research project features studies on how different reaction parameters affect optimize the dispersities that can be accessed. The second part of the research project focuses on systematically studying how polymer dispersity affects polymer properties. While these efforts focus on specific types of polymers, polyvinyl ethers, the last research activity expands the concept of using light to control polymer chain-end reactivity to form other types of polymers.  Results associated with this award have the potential to significantly impact various fields of science and engineering where molecular control over polymer properties is of interest.  Professor Chiu fosters integration of research and education by developing curriculum materials in collaboration with the New York State Master Chemistry Teacher's program to enhance the education of high school chemistry students throughout New York State.    The research is focused on establishing a deterministic method for photoswitchable regulation of polymer dispersity and its applications to block copolymer synthesis by photochemically manipulating the rate of chain propagation versus deactivation of the chain-end in controlled cationic vinyl ether polymerizations. The project features the development of photochromic Bronsted acid initiators that yield polymers with low dispersity in one photoisomeric state, and high dispersity in the other photoisomeric state. In the first objective, the mechanism by which the carboxy-functionalized dithienylethenes enable photocontrol over polymer dispersity in cationic vinyl ether polymerizations is studied, and a comprehensive kinetic model is constructed to guide further optimization of the system. The second objective focuses on the application of the carboxy-functionalized dithienylethene initiators to the synthesis of block copolymers and investigation of their materials properties. The final objective expands the concept of externally manipulating relative rates of chain propagation and chain-end deactivation to achieve control over dispersity in other types of controlled polymerization reactions. The chemistry in this work expands the repertoire of polymerization reaction parameters that can be externally modulated and enables a better understanding of how dispersity influences polymer properties.    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

    "abstractText": "This project, Scholarships for an Undergraduate STEM Access and Inclusion Nexus (SUSTAIN), will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Bradley University (BU). BU is a top-ranked mid-sized private university in Peoria, Illinois, that offers a wide variety of STEM majors and an innovative minor in Sustainability. Over its six-year duration, this Track 2 project will fund scholarships to 22 unique full-time student Scholars who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in mechanical or civil engineering, biology, chemistry, or biochemistry. First-year students will receive up to four years of scholarship support. The project aims to increase student persistence in STEM fields through a holistic approach to provide scholarship recipients with evidence-based interventions and supports, including an orientation bridge program, faculty and near-peer mentoring, shared sustainability-focused intellectual experiences, early engagement in undergraduate research, foundational and financial supports, and training for faculty mentors. The project will include a SUSTAIN Peers group (low-income STEM students not selected for the scholarship) that will increase the size of the SUSTAIN community and allow investigation of the degree to which support activities without financial support have an impact. Scholar and Peer involvement in outreach activities will benefit the local community and future STEM students. The sustainability theme will orient students to address globally important issues through the responsible application of science and engineering. SUSTAIN will be a powerful mechanism to broaden participation in the STEM workforce. The project is designed to substantially improve outcomes for low-income STEM students, advance the understanding of the practices and infrastructure needed to effectively support such students, and offer insights that could be critical for enhancing STEM education and career pathways.    The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of high-achieving, low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need, and ultimately inform and enact a transformational shift in the understanding of and support for BU\u2019s low\u2013income STEM students. Evidence-based student support services and programs that are novel to BU and augment existing supports will be implemented to accomplish the following objectives: 1) Recruitment: Enroll, award scholarships, and support 22 academically talented, low-income students as SUSTAIN Scholars; 2) Retention: Increase first-to-second year retention for SUSTAIN-eligible students by 5%; 3) Identity: Increase STEM identity, self-efficacy, and sense of belonging to the BU community; 4) Graduation: Increase 6-year graduation rate by 10%; 5) Placement: Increase the number of graduates entering employment or post-graduate study in a STEM field after graduation to 95% or above; and 6) Knowledge Generation: Generate and disseminate evidence about the degree to which and how the implementation of a suite of interventions novel to BU and contextualized in the Persistence Framework model contributes towards retention, identity, graduation, and placement outcomes. Utilizing measures of STEM identity and self-efficacy with low-income students at a mid-size private university presents a unique opportunity to fill several gaps in the current research landscape, including understanding how STEM identity develops among low-income students in such institutions. The project will investigate the degree to which novel interventions organized under the Persistence Framework model contribute towards the retention, identity, and graduation of economically disadvantaged students in STEM fields. This project will be evaluated using a 360-degree assessment and feedback process to collect performance and self-appraisal information from multiple perspectives. The results of this project will be made available by presenting at national conferences, publishing findings in relevant journals, and facilitating sustainable implementation of successful interventions in the participating programs and other STEM programs at BU. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of academically talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

    "abstractText": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by conducting research that will inform practices to strengthen the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students. Low-income students struggle to navigate engineering programs, leading to increased underrepresentation of the population. This struggle is, in part, because of the difficulties or strains low-income students encounter in their daily lives and the ways those strains influence their feelings of belonging. Past research finds it increasingly important to understand what role low-income engineering students\u2019 traditional (e.g., assigned at birth; parents, siblings, etc.) and chosen families (e.g., the family they choose; peers, teachers, etc.) play in easing the strains on low-income students. Ultimately, low-income students' familial support may influence their ability to succeed in engineering. Similar research has found that the strains impacting low-income students, and other strains, may impact the students\u2019 families too, making families\u2019 ability to support their low-income students more strenuous. This project explores what strains families of low-income students experience and what impact those strains ultimately have on students' feelings of belonging. Understanding this impact on student belonging can help researchers and practitioners better support low-income students and their families, likely leading to greater enrollment and persistence in engineering programs.    The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of talented, low-income undergraduates in engineering degree programs by investigating the research question: In what ways do the bequeathed strains of socioeconomically disadvantaged students' families impact socioeconomically disadvantaged students' engineering belonging? This exploratory project will collect and retell the stories of twelve low-income students' experiences in engineering, as well as up to ten of each of their family members. These students will be recruited from pre-existing S-STEM programs. Story collection and retelling will focus on low-income students' experiences in engineering, with particular emphasis on identifying who supported their belonging trajectories and how. Family members will provide supplemental narratives that describe what it is like to support a low-income student including what joys and strains come with that support. A case study narrative approach encapsulates both the stories of students and their families, allowing for both a student- and population-level analysis of participants' stories. Resulting narratives and cases will be used to identify what strains families of low-income students experience and, ultimately, how such strains influence the belonging of the students they support. This work supports broader discussions regarding the inclusion of low-income students in engineering. This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

    "abstractText": "This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at the University of Memphis (UofM). The Track 2 S-STEM project focuses on undergraduate engineering students in the Herff College of Engineering. The University of Memphis is a public, urban Carnegie R1 research institution focused on delivering high quality education to over 21,000 students. Over its four-year duration, this Track 2 S-STEM project will fund scholarships to a minimum of 60 unique full-time students pursuing bachelor's degrees in engineering. Specifically, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, will receive multi-year scholarships to defray unmet financial need as well as mentorship and cohort support. The project features a robust program of support for the development of STEM identity in undergraduate engineering students to facilitate academic success, and persistence to graduation. In addition to financial provision, academic and psychosocial support is provided, for example, the opportunity to engage in the STEM Ambassador program. The latter is a K-12 focused outreach initiative that enhances scholar leadership, communication, and disciplinary growth.     The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of high-achieving, low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The project will contribute significantly to understanding of (1) why STEM identities are important for engineering students and how students develop STEM identities; (2) what evidence-based practices best support engineering student self-efficacy, career attitudes, retention, graduation. A distinguishing feature of the program is the multi-tiered approach to mentoring \u2013 faculty mentoring scholars, scholars networking with peers, and scholars (as STEM Ambassadors) mentoring high school students. Over the four-year period, thousands of K-12 students and their teachers will be impacted through the STEM Ambassador program. The STEM Ambassadors will positively impact K-12 students with whom they share similar backgrounds. At the conclusion of the scholarship award period, scholars are expected to attain a bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline and proceed thereafter to the workforce or a graduate program. Formative and summative evaluation will be conducted by the investigators to improve fidelity of program implementation and to assess the extent to which project goals are met. Data collection, using a mixed methods approach, will be carried out through surveys and focus groups. In addition to conference and journal papers, project findings will be disseminated through a website, newsletters and social media.

The project specifies the evolving portfolio management strategies of institutional investors, assesses the impacts of these strategies on tax valuation, assessment and administration, and investigates the connections between corporate portfolios and local strategies to lower tax assessments. The research contributes to knowledge on the housing shortage by analyzing how shifting concentrations of investment in rental housing are impacting urban tax bases and city budgets. The project also contributes to the education and training of an early-career scientist.    This research proposes that increasingly consolidated ownership structures associated with rental housing are disrupting longstanding patterns and trends in tax assessment. The researchers conduct expert interviews, augmented by observations at real estate and tax assessment conferences, to assess how rental management strategies seek to offset investors\u2019 largest yearly operational expense in local property taxes. This analysis is complemented by extended fieldwork to document how the portfolio management strategies of rental investors capitalize upon the specificities of local tax systems, such as using local tax consultants to file property tax appeals or in advocating for project-based tax abatements. Through its focus on the infrastructural dimensions of taxes and the tax code, this project brings together scholarship from Geography, City and Regional Planning, Science and Technology Studies, and Urban Studies, to specify how housing rentiership is redefining the fiscal landscape of US cities.

    "abstractText": "Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming scientific discovery, enabling breakthroughs that were once thought unattainable. In biology, AI-driven models like AlphaFold have revolutionized protein structure prediction, achieving unprecedented accuracy in determining 3-dimensional structures from amino acid sequences. This capability has opened the door to applications ranging from drug discovery to protein engineering. Despite these successes, the inner workings of such models remain a black box, hindering their broader scientific utility and the development of fundamental theories. This project aims to illuminate the internal activity and their correspondence to bio-physical principles by developing advanced visualization and interpretability tools. These tools will allow researchers to gain unprecedented insights into how these AI models operate, fostering a deeper understanding of protein folding processes. By providing open-source software and an interactive Science Gateway, the project will democratize access to these capabilities, empowering a wider range of scientists to explore and refine protein folding theories and showcasing the role of AI in advancing fundamental scientific knowledge.    VizFold tackles the critical challenge of understanding and interpreting the mechanisms underpinning protein folding predictions made by AI models like AlphaFold. While these models excel at accurately predicting protein structures, the processes and principles they use remain opaque, limiting their broader applicability and the development of scientific theories. To bridge this gap, the project focuses on three key objectives. First, it will develop visualization tools to examine activation propagation within the specialized architectural components, including attention mechanisms and structure modules unique to AlphaFold-like models. Second, it will enhance interpretability by applying probing techniques, dimensionality reduction and Layerwise Relevance Propagation, to elucidate how these models encode folding processes. Third, it will build an interactive Science Gateway powered by Cybershuttle, enabling researchers to visualize and analyze model outputs in real-time while offloading computational tasks to high-performance infrastructure. By achieving these goals, VizFold will advance computational biology, support non-expert users, and lay the foundation for a new physical-chemical understanding of protein folding, paving the way for future innovations in AI-driven science.

    "abstractText": "Plant leaves perform vital photosynthetic functions, converting solar energy into sugars that empower all plant processes and directly impact crop yield. Leaves are multicellular organs that develop from meristematic, precursor stem cells, eventually forming complex, three-dimensional shapes that are critical for leaf function. Leaves of maize, a model plant for developmental research, comprise several grass-specific structures and features that maximize photosynthesis and provide structural support to the maize plant. This project will investigate the functional interactions of plant-specific genes with profound impacts on grass leaf development.  The LIGULESS1 (LG1) gene functions to direct expression of other genes (i.e. transcription factors) that are involved in leaf width, length, and angle, with direct impacts on photosynthesis and leaf morphology. Three members of the WUSCHEL-related homeobox3 (WOX3) family of plant transcription factors are required to make leaves grow wide. Mutations in these wox3 genes give rise to short, mutant plants with leaves that fail to wrap-around and support the grass stems, which are thereby susceptible to lodging. Recent work has revealed that LG1 and WOX3 transcription factors interact during three-dimensional patterning of leaf angle and leaf wrapping. Genetic analyses of mosaic plants that have lost LG1 or WOX3 gene expression in specific plant regions during plant growth will reveal the timing, and cell/tissue/organ specificity of their respective functions. Candidate genes required for leaf-wrapping will be identified, and interactions between LG1 and WOX3 proteins will be analyzed in transgenic plants from a related grass, to better understand the mechanisms of grass leaf development. The PI will train undergraduate summer interns through a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program and provide training in state of the art molecular genetics research to a graduate student. The PI will teach a 3 credit science course for incarcerated students seeking an Associate Degree at a NY state penitentiary.     A fundamental question in developmental biology is how growth and differentiation of lateral organs are coordinated along three-dimensions, comprising the dorsiventral, proximodistal, and mediolateral axes. Leaves arise from stem-cell pools called shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and are dorsiventrally-asymmetrical from their inception. Juxtaposition of dorsal and ventral domains organizes leaf-primordial outgrowth from the SAM along the mediolateral and proximodistal axes, creating a leaf that is tall, wide and flat. The maize leaf is an excellent model system for genetic, genomic, and cell-biological investigations of the mechanisms whereby axial development is spatially-regulated and coordinated. At maturity, the maize leaf is a strap-like structure with a distal, photosynthetic blade and a proximal sheath that wraps-around and supports the stem. Patterning of sheath wrapping is decidedly non-random in grasses. At the boundary between the blade and sheath, grass leaves develop a membranous outgrowth of epidermally-derived ligule, and a wedge-shaped auricle that function as a hinge to create leaf angle. Mutations in the grass transcription factor LIGULESS1 (LG1) remove the ligule and auricle, whereas mutations in WUSCHEL-related homeobox3 (WOX3) genes disrupt mediolateral leaf outgrowth and disrupt patterning of sheath margin wrapping. Higher-order wox3 and lg1 mutants reveal that LG1 and WOX3 transcription factors interact during proximo-distal and mediolateral patterning and leaf wrapping. Clonal sector analyses will reveal the ontogenetic timing, tissue-layer specificity, and cell-autonomy of LG1 and WOX3 function. State-of-the-art transcriptomics will identify candidate genes involved in sheath wrapping, and interactions of LG1 and WOX3 proteins will be examined in planta during ontogeny.

    "abstractText": "Glacier melting in polar regions can result in large amounts of freshwater being introduced into the coastal ocean, changing nutrient levels at the surface, impacting organisms like phytoplankton and influencing the distribution and composition of organic material in the water. In this project, researchers will participate in an expedition to the West Antarctic Peninsula in early 2025 that will approach several retreat glaciers, starting from the northern tip of the Peninsula and progressing toward its central region. The team will analyze physical, chemical, and biological changes in the area, and relate these changes to differences in melting trends that have been observed along the Peninsula. Results will help predict future impacts on the region due to increased melting associated with continued warming. The program will provide training for a graduate student and disseminate results of the study across a broad audience.      This project will examine the effects of meltwater input from tidewater glaciers on dissolved organic matter along the West Antarctic Peninsula. While glaciers near the northern tip of the Peninsula show no changes in grounding line discharge trends, several farther south, near Palmer Station, are characterized by significant changes, with discharge trends surging by a factor of 3 in many glaciers. This suggests a north-south gradient in the response of discharge rates to environmental forcing along the Peninsula, likely influencing the vertical flux of nutrients and affecting phytoplankton and the composition and lability of dissolved organic matter. The PIs will take advantage of a cruise-of-opportunity to the West Antarctic Peninsula in February 2025 to collect samples in transects approaching multiple tidewater glaciers, capturing the north-south gradient in discharge trends reported for the region. Samples of seawater and floating ice from glaciers will be analyzed for temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll, particulate and dissolved organic carbon concentrations and lability, and dissolved organic matter composition using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, optics and isotopic analyses. Variations in organic matter composition and lability will be identified and compared along the north-south gradient in discharge trends, which will inform how the system might respond to future increases in glacier melting. Results will also be compared with similar analyses currently being conducted in the Amundsen Sea and the Kerguelen Islands, collectively capturing the influence of meltwater originating from large ice sheets, tidewater glaciers and land-terminating glaciers. The project will support a graduate student who will be trained in the analysis of dissolved organic matter data.

    "abstractText": "PART 1: NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY  Large Language Models (LLMs) are an advanced artificial intelligence method to generate innovative ideas from the processing of copious volumes of information at speeds for which human engagement is simply infeasible, if not impossible. This research project focuses on developing a framework for extracting valuable information from non-text-based, sources to improve, grow and enhance LLMs with a focus on the design of new metallic systems with superior properties and performance. By helping LLMs to ingest and learn from data formats such as graphs, tables, microscopy images and other rich, layered and complex scientific data, this project is using LLMs to uncover relationships in materials that might be overlooked or never discovered by relying solely on textual data from scientific papers, written studies or textbooks. This work supports the realization of broadly democratizing the design process for materials investigations while fostering innovations that could surpass materials performance limits as commonly held today. In this way, this work aligns well with NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science. This project also coincides with the goals of the U.S. Materials Genome Initiative by harnessing the power of materials data and developing a skilled workforce to drive innovation and strengthen U.S. competitiveness in materials science.        PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY  This project aims to establish an effective framework to ingest, inform and leverage multimodal data directly from experiments to advance large language models (LLMs) for hypotheses generation toward the design of new and superior metallic alloys. LLMs have significant potential to produce novel and innovative design hypotheses by integrating textual information across extensive domains of literature at speeds and volumes far beyond human capacity. A even more revolutionary opportunity however, lies in expanding the variety of formats of information available for LLMs to learn from. Presently, LLMs are restricted largely to data contained in text. This research project is actively expanding this also include the rich, complex, layered and multi-modal data found in materials science experiments including, but not limited to: segmented, annotated, quantified and labeled micrographs from SEM and TEM; x-ray diffraction patterns; graphical constructs; and even images. To achieve this aim, this project is building and training enhanced LLMs for the generation of metallurgical design inquiries through the use of high-quality, high provenance, context-rich, metallurgical dataset standards derived from a variety of sources including the research team\u2019s very own experimental data and datasets obtained from open-source literature with all the metadata and context required to ensure high confidence in interpretability and repeatability. This work supports the realization of broadly democratizing the design process for materials investigations while fostering innovations that could surpass materials performance limits as commonly held today. In this way, this work aligns well with NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science. This project also coincides with the goals of the U.S. Materials Genome Initiative by harnessing the power of materials data and developing a skilled workforce to drive innovation and strengthen U.S. competitiveness in materials science.

    "abstractText": "End-linked polymer networks are macromolecules that can be highly stretchable, tough, yet involving low accumulated damage over cyclic loads, making them promising next-generation load-bearing soft materials. Their excellent mechanical properties rely on the potential giant and reversible strain-induced crystallization, which is regulated by defects in the material and with temperature. However, the coupling between strain-induced crystallization, topological defects, temperature, and the corresponding mechanical properties of end-linked polymer networks remains poorly understood. This award will support fundamental research to combine experimental and modeling approaches in understanding mechanisms and developing new end-linked polymer networks with desired mechanical properties. The fundamental understanding developed from this project will benefit the society by enabling novel strong and tough soft materials that can maintain their excellent properties over cyclic loads, hence facilitating emerging applications such as soft robotics, medical devices, and wearable electronics. In addition, the project will bring broader impacts in the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students by introducing students to emerging industrial needs through a new university-industry workshop. The outcomes of the research will be integrated into core undergraduate courses and multiple well-organized outreach activities such as the high school Building Bridges program and the Research Experiences for Teachers Summer Institute, with an expectation to engage a diverse group of students.    The objective of this research is to investigate the fundamental role of topological defects in regulating the strain-induced crystallization in end-linked polymer networks at the microscale, as well as their stress-strain behaviors, fracture, and fatigue properties at the macroscale. To achieve this goal, the project will study a model material system and focus on topological defects of dangling chains and cyclic loops with quantitative tunability. The research will combine experiment and modeling at two length scales, including mechanical characterization at the macroscale and in-situ X-ray scattering characterization at the microscale. The two length scales will be linked by a continuum thermodynamic model, a microscopic polymer fracture model, and a numerical finite element model. The collaborative research will investigate stress-strain responses across a wide range of temperatures, as well as fracture and fatigue behaviors of the model end-linked polymer network.

    "abstractText": "Sociality provides advantages in defense and food resource acquisition, but the ecological landscape of gregarious species is complex and requires accessing and accruing social resources (e.g., allies, friends, and mates) that can impact fitness.  Studies that focus on gregarious primate species have revealed how social resources influence male interactions (e.g., male-male confrontations over hierarchy and mates), but little is known about female-female competition. This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the impact that female competition over males, and the social resources they provide, have in the reproductive success of a close human relative. The study informs the evolution of sociality among primates, provides educational opportunities, and creates pedagogical material.      Studies show that competition for food resources influences female sociality and fitness outcomes, but little is known about the impact and prevalence of social resource competition. Although some non-human primate females have behavioral patterns that suggest they compete over males, who may provide protection and infant care, direct evidence is scarce. This project leverages long-term databases and integrates novel behavioral, demographic, and hormonal data to explore female social resource competition in habituated non-human primates. The study evaluates whether females use competitive behaviors (i.e., aggression and dominance) to monopolize males and receive social benefits from them. Additionally, glucocorticoids and reproductive hormones levels are measured to determine if they influence competitive behaviors in ways that limit or promote access to social resources. The study advances knowledge regarding the causes and consequences of female-female competition, as well as the social and physiological mechanisms through which such competition may influence survival and reproductive success in social animals.

    "abstractText": "Social information can be linguistically represented in many ways, such as with word endings or as part of the word\u2019s definition. For example, some words are stereotypically gendered because the word itself is not linguistically marked for gender, but it still carries information influenced by social experiences. This doctoral dissertation project advances an understanding of how the various representations of social information in nouns differently impact language comprehension and processing. Additionally, this project tests possible social information in adjectives, which has not been previously studied in language processing. Additional benefits to society include educational and workforce development opportunities for undergraduate students who receive training in psycholinguistic research methods.    Research in linguistics shows that gender bias plays a crucial role when forming a coreferential dependency, which is the process of linking a pronoun with a larger noun phrase that the pronoun replaces and refers to. Influence of gender on coreferential dependency formation has been found in online processing measures, with a slowdown in reading times when a noun phrase, though grammatically accessible, is judged by the perceiver as \u201cmismatching\u201d the pronoun in gender. This project uses eye-tracking measures to investigate how differences in processing may reflect differences in the social representation of a word and/or differences in the sentence structure and context surrounding the target word. Additionally, new methods for testing social information are developed. De-identified data and code are made publicly available, as a major goal of this project is providing updated norming results on nouns, as well the first publicly available norming results on adjectives.

    "abstractText": "The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will be achieved by developing and validating cutting edge assessment technology to address two critical problems in math education: a) student learning deficiencies and b) teacher overload and attrition. At the high school level, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) reported that the math scores of U.S. students in 2022 ranked 28th among 37 participating countries, posing substantial risk to the nation\u2019s competitiveness in STEM fields. This occurs while educators\u2019 burnout and attrition is at an all time high. Such significant learning deficiencies in math will cost an estimated $1.1T in GDP due to the loss of workforce productivity and innovation. Meanwhile, available tools and innovations for high school math are drastically low, in comparison to tools available for their K-8 counterparts. In response, this STTR project will develop a web-based system providing highly efficient, personalized, formative assessments that are easily customizable by teachers themselves. By addressing critical classroom and market needs, the project will help improve student math learning, cultivate a competitive and diverse STEM workforce, and contribute to high-tech innovation in a Federal Opportunity Zone in the heart of Midwest.    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a web-based formative assessment system providing highly efficient and personalized assessments that are easily customizable by teachers themselves, empowering teachers to do their work more effectively and efficiently. Unlike traditional adaptive assessment systems that often reduce the teacher\u2019s role, this platform leverages cognitive diagnostic modeling to identify students\u2019 strengths and weaknesses in high school math in real time, both individually and collectively. An innovative machine learning algorithm clusters students for targeted instruction based on their mathematical competencies and current understanding, while also tracking their progress to enable timely interventions. Teachers can regularly and flexibly regroup students based on updated assessments, ensuring that instruction remains tailored to each class\u2019s needs. Additionally, advancements in large language models (LLMs) will be utilized to expand the item bank, supporting the platform\u2019s scalability and meeting ongoing assessment demands in diverse classroom environments. The system\u2019s usability and effectiveness will be validated through a comprehensive pilot study, demonstrating its potential to enhance educational outcomes and streamline teaching processes.

    "abstractText": "The current generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has not only revolutionized real-world applications like conversations. These models have also transformed AI itself, as they can serve as the basis, or foundation, for more specialized AI tasks if given sufficient additional training.  However, building and training these models and specializing them for challenging tasks like planning is hard due to barriers including limited computing resources, limited non-proprietary knowledge, and even limitations on the basic assumptions used to build the models. This effort investigate an alternative path: it creates and trains a specialized AI model, using innovations on current methods, that can be applied to problems involving planning and chains of tasks. The resulting model has the potential to outperform and be more efficient and more understandable at these types of tasks than the current generation of general-purpose Large Language Models. The project offers a unique demonstration opportunity to overcome resource barriers and democratize knowledge, especially for underserved communities. The model development process, resulting AI infrastructure, and accompanying outreach activities will engage research communities from a wide array of academic disciplines at multiple universities including minority-serving institutions.      AI foundation models, optimized primarily for next-token prediction, excel in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, making them effective for natural language and conversational agents. However, these models exhibit significant limitations when applied to tasks from real-world applications requiring sequential decision making, reasoning, and other planning-like tasks. Examples include business processes, guidelines, instructions, programs, and workflows. Previous work on this topic using foundation models has primarily focused on using or fine-tuning pre-trained, off-the-shelf models with limited success. This project will instead investigate a different approach, creating a comprehensive, yet compact, foundation model for planning-like tasks from scratch. This model will be based on innovative approaches for tokenization, training, and other steps that will enable the model to specialize in advanced planning.  The project will follow a transparent, bottom-up methodology for building this new model that will open new avenues for research, education, and real-world applications.

    "abstractText": "Cardiovascular disease is a major health challenge in the US, affecting nearly half of the adult population. Cardiac arrhythmias are widespread threats, presenting a broad spectrum of conditions and life-threatening complications such as stroke and heart failure. In view of the health risks associated with cardiac arrhythmias, there is a strong need to develop more precise diagnostic tools and more effective therapeutic interventions. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project aims to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms that drive cardiac arrhythmias, thereby improving both diagnosis and treatment effectiveness. The project integrates complex computational simulations of various physical phenomena with advanced deep-learning techniques to explore how multiple physiological factors within a human body can contribute to arrhythmias and their initiation mechanisms. The research findings are seamlessly incorporated into educational activities, fostering a highly skilled healthcare workforce with an in-depth understanding of arrhythmia physiology and the cutting-edge methodologies developed in this study.    Current practices of understanding arrhythmia physiology primarily focus on electrical activity. For example, the diagnostic tool used to identify arrhythmias is the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), which records the electrical signals of the heart projected onto the body surface. However, cardiac arrhythmias are complex conditions with multiple physical processes contributing to their initiation, maintenance, and progression. For example, the malfunction of electrical impulses in arrhythmias initially disrupts the mechanical function of the heart muscles. Such mechanical dysfunction, in turn, impairs the heart\u2019s ability to effectively maintain blood flow and pressure, thereby impacting fluid dynamics within the cardiovascular system. This research establishes a holistic research pathway to advance the understanding of arrhythmia physiology. The first objective is to develop high-fidelity multiphysics simulations of cardiac arrhythmias, which simultaneously model the electrical, mechanical, and fluid dynamics, as well as their interdependencies. These simulations provide the foundation for the second objective, which investigates how these multi-physical processes contribute to arrhythmia conditions. The third objective integrates insights from this project\u2019s earlier phases and focuses on uncovering the mechanisms that initiate arrhythmias to advance knowledge of cardiac arrhythmias and support the development of more effective interventions for future research.

    "abstractText": "Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology that overlays digital content onto a user's view of the real world in real time, creating interactive and immersive experiences. AR applications are expanding across various industries, including smart manufacturing, healthcare, navigation, education, and entertainment. Since users may rely on AR applications to directly understand and interact with the physical world, failures and errors in these systems can lead to severe consequences, including safety risks. For instance, a flawed AR-based navigation application could cause accidents or damage the surrounding physical environment. Such real-world risks underscore the critical need for testing and quality assurance practices in AR application development. Despite the demand for high-quality AR applications, their testing support remains in its early stages. The challenge of testing AR applications stems from the difficulty of handling real-world inputs and understanding their outputs blended with real-world scenes. Since real-world test environments are costly to build and difficult to control, alternative environments such as videos and Virtual Reality (VR) test scenes are adopted in practice. This project aims to develop innovative techniques to automate the testing of AR applications for higher efficiency and comprehensiveness and investigate the bug-detection effectiveness of VR test scenes. The project includes plans to engage with students from underrepresented groups in computing and to enrich the software engineering curriculum.     Specifically, this project will develop an infrastructure that allows existing automatic Graphics User Interface (GUI) testing techniques to be applied to AR apps. The infrastructure will (1) automate the test scene construction by loading playback videos and configuring them at runtime, (2) automatically identify interactive areas on the screen by excluding non-interactive objects using dynamic filtering, and (3) automate GUI event triggering by inferring possible interactions of interactive areas through analysis of their event-handling functions. The project will also develop techniques to automate test oracle in AR application testing. The techniques will check inconsistencies between AR rendering and code execution, and predict the correctness of virtual object placement using models trained with labeled screenshots, video frames, and application logs. Additionally, a study will be performed to assess whether VR-based test scenes can accurately simulate real-world scenes and reveal bugs in AR apps. Pairs of real-world scenes and VR scenes will be constructed and test executions of AR apps on them will be compared based on various metrics such as code coverage, mutation scores, and user-perceived rendering difference. The project will further study the automatic revision of VR testing scenes with the guidance of code coverage.

    "abstractText": "With support from the Chemical Structure and Dynamics (CSD) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Cicerone and McDaniel of The Georgia Institute of Technology will develop a novel framework for rationalizing liquid dynamics by connecting fundamental molecular relaxation events to macroscopic properties.  Their approach will combine experimental measurements of relaxation dynamics with simulations to elucidate how molecular excitations facilitate motion across the complex potential energy landscape in glasses and liquids, with intrinsic barriers correlated to thermodynamic quantities of the system. The team will use a combination of neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics with ab initio and machine-learning potentials to validate their framework and explore the universality of liquid behavior across several different molecular structures, classes of inter- and intramolecular forces, and pressures.  Their studies could enable the prediction of macroscopic relaxation and transport processes of liquids based on fundamental thermodynamic parameters, which could lead to new design principles for tailoring bulk properties for various technical applications.  The Cicerone and McDaniel groups consistently provide research experience and opportunities for undergraduate students and participate in several educational outreach activities each year, introducing scientific concepts to local K-12 students.    Transport and relaxation in liquids and glasses occur through microscopic cooperative rearrangements on picosecond timescales and Angstrom length scales. The Cicerone and McDaniel labs have recently quantified the population of particles involved in these elemental relaxations and have shown that the activation free energy for these collective relaxation processes is proportional to that of crystallization for simple liquids. In this project, they will determine how to find these activation barriers for complex systems without a well-defined melting point. They will also connect molecular structure with the topology of sequential microscopic reorganization events that lead to structural relaxation. Finally, they will focus on systematically adapting ab initio force fields to reproduce THz collective motion observed in experiments. These studies will seek to quantitatively reproduce the temperature and pressure dependence of transport and dynamics measured using quasi-elastic neutron scattering, THz Raman scattering, and simulation. Success in these steps will help realize improved efficiency in designing materials and liquids with targeted properties.

    "abstractText": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's Indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions increases the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, supports research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages faculty members to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project, under the direction of a Din\u00e9 College STEM faculty member, directly addresses these goals through research to improve Concentric Ring Electrodes (CREs), noninvasive sensors gaining increased use in measuring electrophysiological signals for medical diagnostic purposes. The goal of this research project is to advance the design of CREs by comparing the tripolar CRE developed at Din\u00e9 College to commercial CREs currently in widespread use. Further, the project will provide opportunities to engage Native undergraduate and graduate students in the research and contribute to the STEM research and instruction capacity of the college.    Concentric Ring Electrodes are gaining increased recognition in electrophysiological measurement due to their ability to estimate the Laplacian (second spatial derivative of the surface potential) at each electrode. Recent FEM modeling results suggest that currently used coefficients are suboptimal, resulting in decreased accuracy of the estimated Laplacian signal and reducing its diagnostic yield. This project will 1) use phantom data to directly compare commercial CREs to the optimal configuration using physical CRE prototypes with dimensions corresponding to CoDe\u00ae and t-Lead electrodes. and 2) directly compare optimal and currently used (via t-Interface pre-amplifier) Laplacian estimation coefficients using physical CRE prototypes with dimensions corresponding to t-Lead electrodes.

App State is a predominantly undergraduate university located in the western region of North Carolina. Over its six-year duration, this Track 2 project will provide scholarships to at least 51 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor's and/or graduate degrees in chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics, or physics. The project will provide up to four years of scholarship to first-year, transfer, and third-year students who plan to attend graduate school at App State, and first-year graduate students. This project will build on the previous App State S-STEM project which resulted in a more than 88% retention rate. Project activities include summer research, flexible team-based study halls, service to the university and community, gatherings with S-STEM alumni, resilience & well-being workshops, leadership training, and a data science STEM theme. The project emphasizes recruiting in the mountain counties surrounding the university, where poverty rates are among the highest in North Carolina. Because App State has a high percentage of first-generation college students, this project has the potential to broaden the participation of these students in STEM fields and to develop a better understanding of how to retain students from this population. In addition, the project has the potential to improve the economic development of the Appalachia region and North Carolina.    The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of high-achieving, low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Specifically, the goals of the project are to increase the overall number and percentage of students coming from the economically disadvantaged Appalachia region, increase the number and percentage of these students who complete a STEM degree, and advance the understanding of what learning and support activities benefit these students. It is well understood that community building and mentoring activities contribute to the success of STEM students. By observing and surveying students, this project will enable a better understanding of the impact of specific activities on students' sense of community, academic self-efficacy, and success in the STEM major. In addition, reviews of institutional records will enable a comparison of S-STEM scholars to STEM majors who are not affiliated with the S-STEM project. For example, measures of persistence, retention, and graduation within a major will be collected to ascertain if there are any differences between S-STEM scholars and non-S-STEM STEM scholars.

Over its six-year duration, this Track 2 grant will fund scholarships, for four years, to 22 unique full-time students pursuing bachelor\u2019s degrees in biology or earth and environmental sciences (EES). The project offers high-impact activities and best practices to achieve stronger retention and graduation rates, increased student learning, and a greater chance of successful transition to STEM-related employment or graduate study upon graduation. Throughout the four years of undergraduate study, cohort activities include curriculum-embedded research, three-tiered mentoring, self-study online tutorial modules for STEM courses, paid summer employment or research internship opportunities, and an enrichment workshop series focused on post-graduate success. An important focus is to prepare scholars to work in basic biological laboratory research, field work, and technology to assume employment in these job sectors that anticipate future growth. Local, state, regional, and national domains will benefit from the addition of academically prepared, well-trained scientists to work in key life science and environmental science fields.     The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of high-achieving, low-income undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Evidence-based activities intend to meet the following objectives: enroll 22 full-time biology or EES majors in three cohorts; award annual scholarships to meet their unmet need; obtain a first-to-second year retention rate of 80%; increase student success rate by 5% in specified undergraduate major STEM requirements known to be hurdles; and support scholars to pursue graduate study or accept employment in a science-related field post-graduation. Assessment efforts will focus on generating knowledge regarding effective program design for diverse student populations. Psychosocial aspects of the enhanced cohort experience and inclusion of family information sessions that address financial concerns will be examined along with STEM job opportunities in fields other than healthcare, and differences in cultural needs of students. Additionally, the findings will contribute to the knowledge base of how the design of four-year STEM programs inform academic and psychosocial effects on student persistence and success in careers in science. Project activities, services, and financial support specifically designed to aid retention will demonstrate their value in retaining students, improving grades, and encouraging students to graduate in four years.

    "abstractText": "Machine learning (ML) is projected to be essential in future autonomy development. However, ML components such as deep neural networks (DNNs) may react unexpectedly to even tiny input variations. Recent incidents in ML-powered systems, such as Tesla and Uber autonomous vehicles, raise an urgent need for techniques and tools to formally verify the safety and robustness of DNNs before utilizing them in safety-critical applications. The state-of-the-art research, focusing on the safety, robustness, and fairness of deep neural networks and neural network control systems, is powerful and promising for some parts of ML-powered autonomy development. However, enabling trustworthy, complex, learning-enabled autonomy is still challenging due to the need for verification technologies for system-level reactive behaviors involving complex interactions between multiple components. This project's novelty is in creating new formal method foundations in modeling, specification, verification, and toolchains to address this grand challenge research problem beyond the state-of-the-art. The project's impact is the substantial enhancements of safety, reliability, and explainability of various learning-enabled unmanned systems. Additionally, the project will strengthen the research and study in autonomy-focused topics in Nebraska by recruiting undergraduate research assistants and integrating research findings into ML and autonomy verification courses. It will also increase the interest and engagement of K-12 group students in STEM majors, science literacy, and broadening participation in computing by participating in outreach events such as the Girl Inc program and The Nebraska College Preparatory Academy Summer Camp. The project team will also collaborate with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Osher Lifelong Learning Institute to give lectures and discussions for adults on how autonomy concepts and technologies may impact their lives.     This project involves two foundational research thrusts, modeling and specification and quantitative verification, along with software and trustworthy autonomy testbed development and rigorous evaluation. The project's expected research outcomes include 1) a new generic graph-based modeling approach for complex, learning-enabled autonomy (CLeA) in which CLeA's components and their interaction are represented using nodes and edges, respectively, 2) a new set-based algebra, built upon the concepts of probilistic star (or shortly ProbStar, a new variant of the well-known star set) and containing a collection of mathematical propositions and important operators such as parallel composition, decomposition, Minkowski sum, etc., that allow users to discover and keep track of the dependency between multiple reachable sets produced by different components in a CLeA and compose/decompose precise inputs for these components in the analysis, 3) a new set-based specification language to specify CLeA's temporal behaviors based on the concepts of ProbStar set representations, 4) a suite of algebra-based depth first search (DFS) reachability algorithms to construct the reachable set traces of all components in CLeA over multiple steps. and 5) a suite of scalable quantitative verification algorithms to quantify the satisfaction of CLeA's temporal properties under uncertainties. Results from proposed research thrusts will be integrated into StarV, a new quantitative verification tool, to enhance its verification capacity for various applications. Indoor and outdoor learning-based autonomous driving testbeds using the F1Tenth platform and Robify robot will be developed to evaluate the proposed verification framework. CARLA simulator, SCENIC, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation will also be used to assess the proposed research in various project phases.

    "abstractText": "Humans live in social groups, but current biocultural changes have led to significant variation in levels of social connectedness or belonging, which may activate the neuro-immune networks that regulate inflammation. Inflammation is a form of stress response that can have negative health effects, but that is also necessary for adaptation and health. To date, studies of social connectedness and inflammation are limited to individuals from populations with similar levels of social belonging, and these studies emphasize negative social conditions, so that the impact of positive social connections remain understudied. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project adopts a biocultural approach to investigate how variations in belonging affect inflammatory regulation dynamics among adults from social contexts with varying levels of belonging.  The study integrates iterative ethnography, with surveys and minimally invasive biological sampling to identify the conditions under which varying levels of connectedness may lead to adaptive or maladaptive inflammatory levels. The study builds STEM capacity through student training, and expands its impact through outreach activities.      Scientists have demonstrated that the inflammatory system is sensitive to social experiences such as belonging and exclusion. Social threats can activate the same conserved neuro-inflammatory pathways as physical ones, involving the hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system\u2019s regulation of acute inflammation. Chronic activation of these pathways can lead to a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) and promote a pro-inflammatory phenotype by impairing the downregulation of inflammation in innate immune cells. While ex-vivo cell culture models have advanced our understanding of these processes, they remain limited by costly and invasive sampling methods that require sterile laboratory conditions. Moreover, the effects of positive social connections on inflammation regulation remain underexplored. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project contributes to biocultural frameworks of belonging and inflammatory regulation by: 1) developing a culturally and geographically specific measure of belonging among peoples experiencing different cultural conditions, 2) adapting an ex-vivo cell culture protocol with dried blood spots for use in field settings, and 3) synthesizing novel data to elucidate how diverse social contexts influence biological variation and health in increasingly complex social settings.

    "abstractText": "Nitrogen (N) is an important part of cells in living beings, and it moves around different parts of the Earth like the air, land, oceans, and the deep interior. This movement helps shape the air we breathe and how suitable our planet is for living things over time. Places where the Earth's plates push against each other, called subduction zones, are excellent for studying how nitrogen moves between the surface and the interior. Recent studies show that these subduction zones send more nitrogen deep inside the Earth than volcanoes belch out. The continental crust might be a good place to store some of the nitrogen that is transferred to the Earth's interior in subduction zones. But scientists need to find out how much nitrogen is really in that crust to see if this idea is correct. In this project, the team will find out how much nitrogen is in the continental crust by taking samples from two places: one in Sierra Nevada, California, and another in the Transverse Ranges, California, and its equivalent lower crust in Chino Valley, Arizona. They will do experiments to see how nitrogen is shared between the lower crust materials and the melting rock. Some of their research will also be part of a summer camp for high school students from the Tucson Unified School District (TUSD). This camp will focus on the geology of Tucson and Arizona to help students connect with their community. The goal is to inspire students to learn more about geosciences and encourage them to study it at the University of Arizona. Since TUSD has many students from underrepresented backgrounds, this camp aims to help make geosciences programs more diverse and create new opportunities in geosciences careers.    The uptake and exchange of the life-essential element nitrogen (N) between the Earth\u2019s surface reservoirs (atmosphere, crust, oceans, biosphere) and the interior (lithosphere and deeper) via plate tectonics has regulated the atmospheric composition and habitability through geological history. The geologically recent subduction zones serve as an excellent natural laboratory to understand these uptakes and exchanges. Current estimates show that the output of nitrogen from subducted slabs is higher than the volcanically outgassed nitrogen. The continental arc crust could be an excellent contender for uptake of the \u2018excess nitrogen\u2019 but to test the hypothesis, the nitrogen abundance of continental arc crust needs to be determined. Also, the nitrogen abundance of primitive arc magmas is a key piece in understanding the fluxes of nitrogen between different subduction zone reservoirs and it is poorly constrained. Lower arc crust comprised of cumulates from differentiation of primitive arc magmas may serve as an excellent proxy to determine the nitrogen abundance of the primitive magmas. In this proposal, researchers will determine the nitrogen abundance of the arc continental crust. They will analyze samples from two sections of lower and mid to upper arc crust \u2013 one from Sierra Nevada, California and the other from Transverse Ranges, California (mid to upper crust) and its tectonically bulldozed lower crust in Chino Valley, Central Arizona. The team will perform nitrogen partitioning experiments between lower crustal cumulate minerals and arc melt. Finally, they will use those partition coefficients along with modeling the fractional crystallization of arc magmas to determine the nitrogen contents of primitive arc magmas that best explain the measured nitrogen abundances in the lower crust. Some aspects of the research plan will be integrated (along with other methodologies in geosciences) in a summer camp for high school students from Tucson Unified School District (TUSD). The summer camp will be themed around the geological history of Tucson and Arizona to provide the students a \u2018sense of place\u2019. The camp will serve as a feeder into a longer-term program to incorporate high school students in research-based education in geosciences. The objective of the summer camp is to motivate local high school students in geosciences, with the expectation that this would eventually result in enhanced enrollment of local high schoolers in geosciences at the University of Arizona. Given TUSD is mostly comprised of students from underrepresented populations, the goal of the summer camp is to diversify geosciences undergraduate enrollment and ultimately the workforce.

    "abstractText": "Software systems often need to handle sensitive data securely, maintain user privacy, and operate efficiently. One way to ensure these qualities is by analyzing how a program behaves when it processes different inputs or runs in different situations. This type of analysis, called relational reasoning, helps uncover important properties like whether a program protects sensitive information or performs tasks consistently. While tools exist for analyzing some programs, they often struggle to handle features like mutable arrays, which are widely used to store and manage data in practical applications. The project\u2019s novelties are creating better tools to analyze programs that use arrays, making the process more precise and broadly applicable. By addressing key challenges in existing techniques, the research aims to bridge gaps in both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. The project\u2019s impacts are improving how we understand and verify programs, and helping create software that is more secure, private, and efficient. The project will provide training in formal verification research for undergraduate and graduate students. The results from the research will be incorporated into university courses taught by the lead investigator.\u2028       This project introduces a formal verification framework to enable precise and general reasoning about relational quantitative properties in programs with mutable arrays. To address the challenge of imprecision, the investigator will leverage fine-grained analysis techniques that capture the behavior of individual array elements rather than treating the entire array as a single unit. This allows for more detailed and accurate verification results. To expand the scope of relational reasoning, the investigator will generalize existing techniques to support a broader range of relational quantitative properties involving mutable arrays, including those beyond current limitations. The research will integrate these advances into a unified framework, combining theoretical insights with practical tool development, and evaluate the system on real-world software. This work is expected to significantly advance the field of relational quantitative reasoning by addressing critical gaps in precision and applicability, leading to better tools for ensuring software correctness and reliability.

    "abstractText": "Nontechnical Description  Since their discovery a century ago, understanding superconductors, which are electronic materials that exhibit zero resistance to electrical current, as well as seeking superconductors with higher working temperatures, have been central objectives in modern physics research, both for their tremendous applicational potential and for fundamental understanding of nature. This CAREER project focuses on developing new tools for investigating a novel class of graphene-based superconductors, understanding the root of their superconductivity, and investigating how to make them work at higher temperatures. This research project also brings significant educational and societal impacts, including outreach activities for undergraduate students, high school students, and to-be K-12 teachers. These activities strengthen the connections among UC Berkeley, other minority-serving institutes, and underrepresented K-12 schools in the California Bay area. The PI also develops a new quantum materials course that supplements the UC Berkeley curriculum with frontier developments in research and will deliver many next-generation quantum-equipped engineers to the US STEM workforce during the span of this CAREER project.    Technical Description  Recently, graphene-based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have emerged as clean, highly tunable, and rich platforms for investigating unconventional superconductivity and other exotic quantum phenomena. However, there are several fundamental challenges in these materials that urgently need resolution to advance the knowledge in this field. The primary research goal of this project is to develop a toolbox to study graphene heterostructures in a reconfigurable manner and use it to elucidate important questions about unconventional superconductivity in these heterostructures, establishing a platform to investigate new quantum phenomena and build new quantum devices. To achieve these specific goals, the PI builds upon his extensive expertise on 2D moir\u00e9 heterostructures, superconductivity, and on-chip electromechanical devices. The outcomes from this project will answer the following important questions: 1) What are the necessary conditions to induce unconventional superconductivity in twisted and untwisted graphene heterostructures? 2) What is the mechanism behind the enhancement of this unconventional superconductivity by proximity to monolayer transitional metal dichalcogenides? These answers are of utmost importance for designing next-generation superconductors with higher transition temperatures. This knowledge can lead to the development of smaller, more efficient electronic devices and quantum computers, enhance power grid efficiency, and improve technologies relying on strong magnetic fields like MRI and maglev trains. This research also provides deeper insights into quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics, potentially uncovering new physical phenomena and exotic states of matter.

Key open-source stakeholders, including representatives from higher education, the not-for-profit sector, and industry, will be convened to share expertise with a view toward developing practical guidance for sustaining open-source software (OSS) across the research enterprise. Representatives from these communities will identify actionable pathways that researchers and universities can take to build a robust and sustainable research OSS ecosystem. The workshop envisions two primary outcomes. First, participants will return to their home institutions with concrete and prioritized ideas about how to build sustainable research OSS communities on campus. Second, they will publish findings from the workshop, including findings for researchers, administrators, and other stakeholders, that will focus on how to create and sustain robust OSS infrastructures in diverse university settings. These findings will also describe best practices for how to translate these \"actionable pathways\" into practical guidance and models that other institutions can adopt. This project may also contribute to the health and sustainability of the academic research enterprise and open science as a whole.  \u00a0  The workshop will provide an opportunity for focused discussion of sustainability issues specific to open source in university environments. The workshop will promote dialog between representatives of academic and administrative OSS communities together with the research OSS community. This latter group develops highly specialized applications designed to meet the unique needs of distinct research communities that can easily exist in isolation from each other. Taken individually, these distinct communities may struggle to attract sustained attention and support. The core questions that will be explored at the workshop are: a) What lessons can OSS research communities learn from the experiences of academic, administrative, and industry open-source developers?; b) What opportunities exist for collaboration between disparate OSS communities on campus to improve the climate for OSS generally, and OSS for research purposes specifically? How might those opportunities be leveraged across a wide range of institutional types, presenting different research profiles and resources?; and c) What core sustainability differentiators exist between academic and administrative open-source practices and open-source practices in science and research? What novel sustainability solutions could address these differentiators?

    "abstractText": "Bacteria are ubiquitous with wide-ranging impacts on human health, agriculture, biotechnology, and the environment. In many circumstances, bacteria exist in non-ideal conditions where they cope with stresses to survive and grow. With a single stress, bacteria can commit their resources to counter that sole threat, and most knowledge of bacterial stress responses comes from single stress conditions. However, stresses are rarely isolated, and when more than one stress is present, how resources are distributed to cope with simultaneous challenges remains largely an open question. This is especially true when one of the stresses is starvation for an essential nutrient, such as iron, which is involved in many biological processes. The goal of this project is to increase understanding of how iron-starved bacteria, which are prevalent in diverse environments (e.g., inside immune cells and soil), cope with additional stresses. The additional stress to be investigated is nitric oxide, which is a toxic metabolite produced by immune cells and soil bacteria that can co-occur with iron starvation. This project is poised to positively impact human health and agriculture, as well as increase public awareness of and participation in biosciences and bioengineering through working with high school, community college, undergraduate, and graduate students.      This project investigates how Fe-starved Escherichia coli defend themselves against nitric oxide and examines why Fe-starved Pseudomonas aeruginosa cannot do the same. Notably, these bacterial species comprise opposite extremes of adaptability in this multi-stress condition (robustness and paralysis), which provides the opportunity to reveal principles of adaptation for Fe-starved bacteria. The scientific questions to be addressed include: (i) How is Fe provided for stress responses in Fe-starved bacteria? (ii) How do Fe-strapped metabolisms, which restrict production of reducing power, supply enough reducing power for new stress responses? (iii) What distinguishes organisms that can adapt to new stresses when Fe-starved (e.g., E. coli) from those that cannot (e.g., P. aeruginosa)? These questions focus on resource recycling and regulation in Fe-starved bacteria and to answer them genetic mutants, tools from synthetic biology, mass spectrometry, and systems-level modeling are used. Results from this project will elucidate principles of adaptation for Fe-starved bacteria that are likely to be applicable to microbes constrained for resources in other ways. Such constraints are usually due to the universal importance of recycling and regulation to the survival of starved bacteria.

    "abstractText": "This project will examine how faculty communication influences the development of engineering identity among undergraduates at California State University Northridge (CSUN), a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). Faculty communication plays a pivotal role in shaping students\u2019 perceptions of themselves as future engineers, particularly during the \"sophomore slump\" phase. This period is a critical juncture in students\u2019 academic journeys, as they transition from introductory coursework to more rigorous, discipline-specific engineering courses. Faculty interactions during this phase can significantly impact students' confidence, motivation, and sense of belonging in the field. For Latinx students, especially Latinas, this phase often coincides with heightened challenges stemming from systemic barriers, including ethnic and gender stereotyping, that undermine their academic and professional engineering identities. Understanding the nuances of faculty-student interactions during this period is essential for identifying practices that support student success.  This project aligns with NSF\u2019s mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare by addressing persistent equity gaps in STEM fields. By investigating the interplay between faculty communication and engineering identity development, the project will contribute valuable insights into how institutional practices can create more equitable pathways for Latinx students in engineering.  The findings will serve as a foundation for the development of evidence-based interventions and programs aimed at fostering inclusive and supportive educational environments. Ultimately, the project will advance the broader societal goal of creating a diverse and equitable STEM workforce, positioning CSUN as a model for HSI institutions nationwide.    This project will investigate the influence of faculty communication on the development of engineering identity among Latinx students at CSUN by addressing the \u201csophomore slump\u201d period, a pivotal stage in a student\u2019s academic journey. The proposed research will use a mixed-methods approach, including a cross-sectional survey and a diary study, to capture both overall trends as well as detailed, real-time data on faculty-student interactions. Drawing on identity development and confirmation theories, this study will examine the impact of confirming and disconfirming faculty messages, the role of minority stressors, and the effects of stereotype consciousness on students\u2019 academic and professional identity formation. Additionally, the project will explore how message characteristics, such as type, frequency, and memorability, affect students\u2019 perceptions of the engineering climate at CSUN. The findings will inform the creation of actionable strategies, including faculty onboarding and professional development programs, designed to foster inclusive and supportive educational environments. By aligning with NSF goals to broaden participation in STEM, this initiative aims to enhance retention and success among Latinx engineering students, ultimately contributing to a more diverse and inclusive STEM workforce.

    "abstractText": "Multilayer coatings are important technologies for numerous industries, including the automotive, aerospace, marine, and consumer-products sectors. The coatings industry needs new capabilities to create multilayer coatings in one step. However, processes for making multilayer coatings are not fully understood, and existing models typically fail to predict coating composition at industrially relevant conditions. This project will develop a multiscale modeling framework that will empower scientists and engineers to (re)formulate coatings, shortening the research and development cycle in academic and industrial settings. New educational tools for teaching nanoscale engineering using virtual-reality technology will be created and disseminated to K\u201316 students and the public. The project will also broaden participation in STEM through undergraduate research opportunities, help train a more competitive U.S. workforce in computational science, and develop and disseminate open-source scientific software.    This project will create a transformative multiscale modeling approach to predict the composition of colloidal-particle coatings made by solvent drying with unprecedented accuracy using: (1) a physics-based continuum model with realistic particle interactions and hydrodynamics, (2) a machine-learned model, trained from particle-based simulations, to refine the physics-based model, and (3) a surrogate model, constructed from (1) & (2), to relate particle properties and processing conditions to composition. This research will create new knowledge about how composition gradients form in colloidal-particle coatings under realistic conditions.  It will enable the first systematic study of how surface chemistry and processing control the formation of self-stratified layers in coatings as well as the feasibility of forming other composition gradients. This project will also develop a virtual-reality (VR) platform for (1) visualizing nanomaterials in accessible technology such as cell phones and (2) making educational VR activities with less effort. The activities will incorporate products of the research and other nanoscale concepts in chemical engineering, and they will be delivered to K\u201312, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as the public through coursework and outreach.

    "abstractText": "Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology that overlays digital content onto a user's view of the real world in real time, creating interactive and immersive experiences. AR applications are expanding across various industries, including smart manufacturing, healthcare, navigation, education, and entertainment. Since users may rely on AR applications to directly understand and interact with the physical world, failures and errors in these systems can lead to severe consequences, including safety risks. For instance, a flawed AR-based navigation application could cause accidents or damage the surrounding physical environment. Such real-world risks underscore the critical need for testing and quality assurance practices in AR application development. Despite the demand for high-quality AR applications, their testing support remains in its early stages. The challenge of testing AR applications stems from the difficulty of handling real-world inputs and understanding their outputs blended with real-world scenes. Since real-world test environments are costly to build and difficult to control, alternative environments such as videos and Virtual Reality (VR) test scenes are adopted in practice. This project aims to develop innovative techniques to automate the testing of AR applications for higher efficiency and comprehensiveness and investigate the bug-detection effectiveness of VR test scenes. The project includes plans to engage with students from underrepresented groups in computing and to enrich the software engineering curriculum.     Specifically, this project will develop an infrastructure that allows existing automatic Graphics User Interface (GUI) testing techniques to be applied to AR apps. The infrastructure will (1) automate the test scene construction by loading playback videos and configuring them at runtime, (2) automatically identify interactive areas on the screen by excluding non-interactive objects using dynamic filtering, and (3) automate GUI event triggering by inferring possible interactions of interactive areas through analysis of their event-handling functions. The project will also develop techniques to automate test oracle in AR application testing. The techniques will check inconsistencies between AR rendering and code execution, and predict the correctness of virtual object placement using models trained with labeled screenshots, video frames, and application logs. Additionally, a study will be performed to assess whether VR-based test scenes can accurately simulate real-world scenes and reveal bugs in AR apps. Pairs of real-world scenes and VR scenes will be constructed and test executions of AR apps on them will be compared based on various metrics such as code coverage, mutation scores, and user-perceived rendering difference. The project will further study the automatic revision of VR testing scenes with the guidance of code coverage.

    "abstractText": "Previous research has found that social factors influence linguistic differences among language users. However, individuals can hold numerous social identities, which may intersect with each other to influence linguistic variation. This doctoral dissertation project examines the factors that lead to linguistic similarities and differences between social groups, and how this relates to individuals\u2019 understanding of the place where they live. In doing so, this research advances scientific theories of how linguistic patterns vary among language users and dynamically change over time. Additional benefits to society include educational and workforce development opportunities for undergraduate research assistants who receive training in research methods. In addition, data are publicly shared through community and academic repositories. Finally, the data collected in this project may be used to develop educational materials and promote awareness of dialect variation.    This doctoral dissertation project investigates the effect of social meanings on language variation and change. This project advances two related goals. The first goal increases a scientific understanding of the factors that lead to linguistic similarity or differences between social groups. The second goal identifies associations between certain linguistic features and geography and how these associations influence linguistic behavior. Because these language-place associations may or may not be shared across specific social lines, this project asks if they play a role in explaining why speakers of different social groups do or do not share certain linguistic characteristics. These research questions are addressed through long-term observation and immersion in the community of interest, to gain an understanding of how community members understand the place where they live, and interviews with a sample of community members. Linguistic characteristics of interest, consisting of certain vowels and consonants, are acoustically measured and quantified. Statistical models that include both linguistic factors and social factors are used to identify predictors of linguistic behavior.

At the same time, quantum computers will be incapable of solving certain problems efficiently. The goal of this project is to advance quantum security by constructing new forms of cryptography based on quantum mechanics, which show it is possible to hide information in the physical properties of quantum systems. This will demonstrate the limitations quantum computers will face in learning physical properties of quantum systems. It may also enable new ways of hiding information in a way which is secure even against an adversary with a quantum computer. This project includes an integrated education and outreach program to build a robust pipeline of talent to push the field of quantum computing forward.     The goal of this project is to construct quantum variants of pseudorandomness which are quantum analogues of pseudorandom generators. Instead of generating numbers which are indistinguishable from random, the goal is to instead construct quantum states which hide some of their quantum mechanical properties, such as their entanglement. This project aims to construct four new forms of quantum pseudorandomness tailored to different applications. These constructions will be designed to 1) show that it is cryptographically hard to deduce the entanglement of quantum systems which arise as ground states of local Hamiltonians, 2) create new post-quantum cryptographic primitives from learning properties of quantum states, 3) create new ways of testing if quantum devices are functioning properly, and 4) tackle core questions in quantum complexity theory, such as the complexity of implementing unitary transformations of quantum systems.

    "abstractText": "The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) services leads to a new era of agent-based machine learning (ML), where decisions are made by integrating multiple and distinct ML tasks. This introduces critical trust issues in AI outcomes since each ML agent operates independently and uniquely due to multimodality and uncertainty. It presents significant challenges to establishing trust among the distinct ML agents since there are no specific metrics and methods to justify the activities of each independent ML agent during training and execution. This research project aims to facilitate a trustworthy AI research infrastructure for solving interdisciplinary multi-modal and multi-agent ML learning tasks by developing an evidence-based trust metrics framework. This framework establishes foundational engineering principles essential for securing AI systems in several domains such as medical, transportation, military, and critical infrastructure. The framework enables trustworthy AI development compliance to enhance the ability to safely and securely build AI systems based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance. The success of this research can provide hands-on learning and research opportunities focused on AI risk, machine learning, trustworthy multi-modal and multi-agent AI system design, and data science for undergraduates and graduate students. The project's impact leads to innovation and research in trustworthy AI, experiential learning curriculum development, and diverse workforce development in the domain of safe and secure AI systems, cybersecurity, AI task force, and interdisciplinary AI applications. The research outcome leads to a trustworthy AI development educational platform for mentoring and training high school and K12 students in multi-modal and multi-agent AI system design.    This project develops a novel AI cyberinfrastructure testbed and enables an evidence-aided symbolic reasoning framework to facilitate a trustworthy ML development readiness to solve interdisciplinary AI challenges. One of the fundamental goals is to investigate and develop trust metrics as a measure of symbolic reasoning for interdependent ML agents. Those metrics must be capable of combining AI decisions, capturing uncertainty considering all evidence, combining rules, and multi-criteria for decision-making. Therefore, this research 1) investigates evidence theory to develop a symbolic reasoning framework for defining trust metrics of the ML pipeline; 2) develops a novel reasoning algorithm for monitoring and incident response, risk severity analysis, and reliable ML agents designed for interdisciplinary AI application; 3) creates a novel AI cyber-infrastructure testbed to develop, realize, and control the over 100,000 heterogeneous and distributed ML agents; and 4) implements two applications of multi-model multi-agent ML tasks, in the domain of cyber readiness and medical use, for justifying the effectiveness of the framework. The successful compilation of the evidence-aided symbolic reasoning AI development framework establishes trust among ML agents while it facilitates cyberinfrastructure for solving interdisciplinary multi-modal multi-agent ML tasks.

    "abstractText": "Many organizations and households possess heterogeneous computing resources, including personal computers, smartphones, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, many of which often remain underutilized. By harnessing this idle computing power to train deep learning models, the need for additional equipment can be reduced, environmental impacts from manufacturing and electronic waste can be minimized, and sustainability can be promoted. As the prevailing heterogeneous learning framework, Federated Learning does not allow data sharing among devices. However, many applications in smart homes, industrial environments, and institutions could benefit from distributed learning systems that enable data sharing across heterogeneous devices. For example, a hospital can use its existing computers to train a large language model for healthcare services without sending any sensitive health information to an external provider, while the data can be shared internally across these computers to improve model performance. Such systems face challenges, particularly when training complex models, as devices with low computational power are often excluded because they cannot handle the complexity of these models. Efficient data sharing and utilization across heterogeneous devices is another significant hurdle. To address these challenges, United Learning unites all devices in a distributed system to train complex models efficiently while allowing data sharing among devices. This project also contributes to designing new learning modules focused on distributed learning across devices with constrained resources. It offers students direct and practical experience to work with real devices that have limited resources. Such engaging experiences can inspire and support underrepresented minorities in pursuing careers and research in computing.    United Learning aims to integrate low-resource devices into the training of complex deep learning models, handling diverse input modalities and data distribution. The approach consists of two primary components: Knowledge Expansion and Supplementary Exemplar Augmentation. Knowledge Expansion organizes devices into learning groups based on their computational capabilities, with each group training a model that expands progressively as it moves to groups with higher resources. The model expansion may involve adding new neural network blocks for different data modalities or increasing the depth of the model to enhance its expressive power. This iterative process ensures that models evolve toward the desired complex form. Supplementary Exemplar Augmentation addresses efficient data sharing by collecting exemplars from each device and training a Supplementary Exemplar Generator. Supplementary Exemplar Generator generates supplementary exemplars from other devices\u2019 data in a self-supervised manner. These exemplars are sent back to augment each device\u2019s local dataset, improving efficiency by only exchanging representative data. Supplementary Exemplar Augmentation and Knowledge Expansion are integrated, with Supplementary Exemplar Augmentation dynamically generating exemplars during the Knowledge Expansion process, further balancing resource usage and maximizing efficiency. Evaluation includes simulations to assess model performance, on-device prototypes to measure device performance, and real-world system deployment to examine system performance.

    "abstractText": "For thousands of years seeds have been a crucial part of our diet and that of domesticated animals. Seeds are nutritious because during the latter part of their development (maturation) they accumulate starch, protein and fats (seed filling), to feed the germinating seedling. The regulation of the seed filling process is only partially understood. In particular, what controls the dynamic way in which seed filling genes are turned on or off only in certain cells and at certain times within embryos inside the seeds is unclear. It is crucial, then, to study gene expression at the single-cell level, which will be done using a novel technique called single-nucleus RNA sequencing. What this means is to isolate plant embryos of the right developmental stages, purify their nuclei, and see which genes are on (\u201cexpressed\u201d) in each cell. The process will be studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, of the mustard and canola family.  These data will provide a three-dimensional atlas that indicates which genes are expressed when and where. Computational techniques will then be applied to this dataset to help us reconstruct \u201cgene regulatory networks\u201d, that is, diagrams that show which genes control which others. Using these networks, new genes that control maturation and seed filling are expected to be found. This atlas will be useful for other members of the research community studying seed maturation and could contribute to improving nutritional content in seed crops. Additionally, this project will provide undergraduate students with hands-on experience in cutting-edge research, helping to advance the nation\u2019s scientific competitiveness. Outreach will be performed through a weekly science show on a public radio station, and through activities with a local high school.     The overall goal of this project is to increase the understanding of the maturation phase in dicot embryos and the regulation of the accompanying accumulation of storage products (seed filling). The onset of the maturation program dramatically changes the gene expression profile of the seed and is tightly regulated. The seed filling process is a spatially dynamic process, starting in certain tissues and later expanding to the rest of the embryo. The spatial aspects of this developmental transition have never been carefully examined, and it is unclear how the tissue-specific expression of the genes involved is controlled. Prior transcriptomic analyses of maturation phase embryos have all employed whole embryos. Here, embryos will be sampled from key time points during seed maturation and single-nucleus RNAseq will be used to generate a publicly accessible three dimensional database of cellular states. Tissue-specific gene regulatory networks will be reconstructed and lead to the expected finding of novel regulators of seed filling, which will later be validated and characterized.

    "abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in its potential to transform sepsis diagnostics and patient care, particularly for vulnerable newborns. Globally, sepsis is responsible for up to a third of neonatal deaths, with an increased burden in low- and middle- income countries. Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on blood cultures, which require substantial blood volumes, take 24+ hours to yield results, and frequently produce false negatives. The proposed DNA-based technology seeks to comprehensively identify and quantify pathogens in a few hours from small volumes of blood, critical capabilities for low-birthweight and immunocompromised newborns. The clinical impacts could include more targeted antibiotic therapy and guided therapy durations that could translate to thousands of lives saved annually, shortened hospital stays, and reduced readmission rates. This technology's compatibility with existing digital PCR hardware enables a very capital-efficient development path and reduces barriers to adoption in hospitals given the expanding use of digital PCR in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Enabling routine pathogen testing for sepsis in any community hospital represents a major opportunity. The core proposed technologies can build on a growing installed base of compatible hardware, adding new tests in other diverse applications.    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a rapid diagnostic test for sepsis-causing pathogens in plasma samples with available digital PCR hardware that can scale to cover all critical pathogens. Pathogen identification tests must be very sensitive, fast, and able to detect a wide range of organisms. Specific innovations are proposed to make the test suitable for neonates with less than 1 mL of blood per test. Currently, digital PCR-based technologies achieve state-of-the-art sensitivity with results in a few hours but are limited in their panel breadth, typically detecting no more than a dozen analytes simultaneously. DNA sequencing can achieve comprehensive detection but is complex, costly for on-demand use, and much slower than PCR. The proposed technology combines advanced primer design with statistical algorithms to achieve critical features by targeting microbial cell-free DNA in plasma. The research objectives include developing an initial 17-target panel for common sepsis-causing pathogens and achieving analytical sensitivity below 5 genome copies/mL with turnaround time under 4 hours. Anticipated results include demonstration of clinically relevant analytical sensitivity and high analytical specificity in plasma samples.

    "abstractText": "This U.S.-French joint research project addresses the growing interest in modeling, analyzing, and generating 3D shapes and movements of human bodies and faces. Advances in scanning technology, 3D mesh-extraction algorithms, computer vision, and hardware-accelerated computer graphics have enabled access to large-scale datasets of human body representations. However, while artificial intelligence and machine learning have achieved remarkable success in processing image data, working with 3D shapes in the form of meshes presents unique challenges that often degrade performance in common computer vision and graphics tasks. To overcome these challenges, this project aims to integrate rigorous shape analysis concepts into the design of geometric deep learning models. These models will directly process raw 3D surface scans, independent of acquisition methods, to develop robust algorithmic pipelines for key problems in human body and face analysis. Applications of this work include single-object data representation and reconstruction, body motion generation, facial expression retrieval, and automatic animation. Beyond its implications for augmented and virtual reality, the project will train graduate students and strengthen collaboration between investigators from four institutions in the U.S. and France.    The research focuses on developing efficient deep learning architectures that incorporate fundamental shape invariances into machine-learning pipelines. It consists of three key thrusts: (1) Invariant 3D-to-3D Registration and Reconstruction: This thrust will develop a framework adapted to human body shapes and face scans, combining mathematical shape analysis concepts with advancements in latent space and auto-encoder models in computer graphics; (2) Extension to Time-Dynamic (4D) Data: Building on static 3D data, this thrust will extend methods to dynamic 4D data (3D plus time) for motion analysis and generation. The approach will involve constructing a non-linear structure in the human shape latent space, using a blend of data-driven techniques and physically motivated elastic deformation energies. This will allow accurate modeling of the complex nature of real-life human body motions and deformations; and (3) Prompt-to-Shape Learning: This thrust will focus on mapping prompts, such as text or voice recordings, to shape spaces. Through these efforts, the project seeks to advance the state of geometric deep learning and its applications while fostering international collaboration and academic training.

    "abstractText": "Basic research into understanding how children learn physics concepts has been pursued relatively independently in several different disciplines (cognitive psychology, developmental science, and physics education research), each of which has come to very different conclusions. One research literature suggests that people's pre-educational intuitions about mechanical physics are largely veridical, another literature suggests that these intuitions are largely incorrect, and yet another suggests that they are incorrect in infancy but become veridical even before significant physics education. These seemingly contradictory findings complicate the development of educational interventions, since interventions suggested by one line of research are contraindicated by others. The overarching goal of this project is to start synthesizing and reconciling these different lines of work. The project is inherently interdisciplinary and will depend on new and emerging methods for robust and reproducible research such as automated online testing, citizen science, and advanced analytics. Such tools are increasingly important in human research but relatively little training in them for students is available. Thus, the educational component of this CAREER project will focus on enhancing such training and includes updating an innovative, interactive textbook on computational modeling and analysis, developing and running an intensive summer training program for citizen science; and providing undergraduates with direct, hands-on education. The project is funded as a CAREER award by the EDU Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literatures on STEM learning, broadening participation, and workforce development.     Multiple research literatures have engaged questions about the nature of intuitive understandings of mechanical physics, but they have often supported discrepant conclusions, thereby making ambiguous what their implications are for the characterization of fundamental cognitive architecture as well as for the design of educational interventions. Moreover, because these conclusions arise from different disciplinary communities studying different populations using different methods, it is not clear whether these discrepancies reflect real differences in how people think about different physical processes in different situations or whether they are simply artifactual. Objective 1 of this project will apply the tools of psychophysics in order to test the reliability of a range of tasks developed in these literatures in an attempt to determine whether differential performance (if any) suggests multiple underlying cognitive systems. Objective 2 will use the tools of developmental psychology to study age-related differences in children on tasks adapted from the range of literatures to see whether the developmental patterns observed by developmental scientists are specific to their methods. Objective 3 will investigate whether the measures developed in these disciplines differentially predict student success in introductory university physics. Thus, the three objectives will systematically assess and compare the stimuli, tasks, and research methods common to the currently-disjoint literatures, allowing for direct comparison and synthesis, with subjects ranging in age from 6 months to adults. All three objectives will involve unusually large and diverse samples --- often by utilizing automated online testing and citizen science -- and advanced analytics. By attempting to reconcile these relatively disjoint literatures, the project will have the potential to contribute to the development of educational interventions in physics at a variety of ages.

    "abstractText": "This project aims at understanding the interactions between microplastics, soil, and microorganisms. As minuscule plastic fragments slowly break down in soil, they create a zone at their surface called a plastisphere, a unique microbial habitat that is reshaping the subterranean landscape. This plastisphere alters the properties of its surroundings, differing markedly from neighboring soil in how easily it erodes, interacts with water, and provides habitat to millions of microbes. The study would describe possible mechanisms for microbe mobility and changes in microbial diversity, that could have public health and ecological implications. This research would provide information that could guide efforts to mitigate the potentially far-reaching impacts of microplastics in soils. This is a project jointly funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Directorate for Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement. This Agreement allows a single joint US/UK proposal to be submitted and peer-reviewed by the Agency whose investigator has the largest proportion of the budget. Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.    A multidisciplinary international team from Cornell University and the University of Aberdeen, in the UK, aims to disentangle the interactions between physical, biogeochemical, and microbial processes in the plastisphere. The research has three phases. First, the team will examine how various microplastics, including biodegradable ones, age in different soils, assessing their impact on the pores that provide microbial habitat and water transport pathways. Next, the investigators will explore plastisphere development under diverse environmental conditions, tracking spatial and temporal changes. Finally, the researchers will investigate how the plastisphere influences water dynamics and microbial transport, using advanced modelling to predict potential environmental impacts. To achieve these goals, the researchers will deploy a suite of cutting-edge techniques, that span multiple scales, from microscopic observations to field-level assessments. The plastisphere will be visualized using 3D X-Ray tomography, while spatial surface biogeochemical and molecular biology measurements will help decipher the chemical, biological, and physical drivers at play. Of particular interest is the use of innovative DNA tracers to track microbial movement through the altered soil landscape.

    "abstractText": "As urban contexts are changed by migration, redevelopment, and new technologies, residents are responding with complex forms of financial speculation that are oriented both to historically salient features of those neighborhoods, such as the religious and cultural traditions that have defined them, as well as layered aspirations about how revaluation may be shaped in the future. Much of this can be understood by exploring how residents manage financial assets in response to predictive governance technologies (speculative financial and other infrastructures, that manifest in housing appraisal, mortgage calculation, and crime prediction). The project trains a graduate researcher in qualitative methods of data collection and establishes research collaborations for future scientific capacity. The products of this research will be shared with community stakeholders, improving the public\u2019s understanding of anthropological science and ethnographic scientific methods.     This research examines the relationship between financial speculation, religious neighborhood organizations, and housing development. The project consists of twelve months of ethnographic and archival research including semi-structured interviews, audio-visual recording, and spatial analysis. The researcher asks how different anticipations for a neighborhood are formed and sustained by engagement with financial practices and infrastructures; how historical relationships interact with present day revaluation; and how new liquid assets are derived not only from housing, but also from public safety and design projects. The findings have intellectual merit for advancing anthropological theory related to the influence of religious tradition on socioeconomic behavior, particularly with respect to speculative technologies, as well as better understanding and confronting the convoluted processes of liquidity and assetization in contemporary markets.

    "abstractText": "This research is a comprehensive archaeological study of early human settlements in rural settings. This research builds on previous research, combining targeted excavations and remote sensing techniques to examine the site's occupation both during the height of its the occupant society's power and its subsequent decline. Past scholarship has predominantly focused on urban centers and the centralized power of the ruling elite, often overlooking rural settlements that played a vital role in an imperial landscape. Archaeological surveys have identified a significant expansion of rural settlements during the empire\u2019s peak, yet the nature of these settlements remains underexamined. This project addresses this gap by investigating the importance of rural communities and political power. The research includes students and local archaeologists who are being trained to enable future mapping and analysis.     This project examines the relationship between imperial settlement policies and local community dynamics, focusing on agricultural organization, production, and the interaction between rural communities and the surrounding environment.  Through the excavation of large building complexes and domestic spaces, the project investigates agropastoral production and storage practices that were crucial to the local economy. The team employs advanced remote sensing methods, including magnetic gradiometry, to map subsurface site features and landscape. The project involves a robust sampling and analysis program, utilizing isotopic analysis of faunal and botanical remains, as well as ceramic and sediment analysis, to evaluate the extent of centralized administration, local subsistence strategies, and human-environment interactions. This interdisciplinary research has the potential to shed light on how ancient imperial projects influenced rural life and how these communities adapted during periods of political instability and collapse.

    "abstractText": "Subduction zones represent a boundary between Earth's tectonic plates where one slides under the other. Subduction zones host the largest earthquakes on Earth, and recent research has revealed more complex deformation events that take place over periods of months or years (referred to here as slow slip and tremor or SST). SST events do not have the sudden destructive power of earthquakes but they can influence the occurrence of large earthquakes. Despite the near ubiquity of SST in modern subduction zones, the mechanisms that drive SST remain poorly understood, in part because direct observations of processes occurring deep in the Earth's crust are not possible. Rocks that have been subducted to SST depths and brought back up to the surface provide a window into processes happening deep in subduction zones. This project will: (1) investigate the types of rocks that potentially hosted SST by analyzing the minerals that make up the rocks, including the ages, chemistry, and deformation and (2) compare the rock record to geophysical imaging of modern subduction zones by modeling the geophysical signature of these rocks based on the observations. Collectively, the results of this work will reveal the distribution of potential SST sources as preserved in the rock record and how they correlate to modern subduction zones. This project involves extensive international collaborations and training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoctoral scholar. Additionally, as part of this work yearly workshops will be developed in seismic properties, rheology/deformation and geochronology/geochemistry tailored in subduction zone science for the participants of the project. These workshops will result in scientific/methodologic resources and workflows for future research on rock record evidence of SST. These materials will become publicly available as resources for the subduction zone research community.    At the base of the seismogenic zone stored elastic energy may be released gradually in slow slip events along with low frequency earthquakes and non-volcanic tremor that contribute significantly to the seismic cycle. This project addresses long-standing questions on whether slow slip events can be hosted in metasedimentary or meta-mafic rocks and the potential spatial distribution of SST sources. Geophysical studies find that SST often coincides with sheared and underthrusted metasedimentary rocks or with the uppermost oceanic crust of the downgoing slab. However, field observations integrated with experimental constraints suggest that metasedimentary rocks are not good candidates for SST sources. Three subduction complexes were selected that span deep SST depths and offer excellent exposures of underplated metasedimentary rocks intercalated with meta-mafic and meta-ultramafic lithologies. The project will investigate evidence of SST in these complexes (e.g., vein networks, geochemical signatures of alteration) using a field-based approach coupled with geochronology/geochemistry, structural geology, microstructural analysis, and rheology. By using the results from the rock record to calculate seismic properties coupled with the geophysical observations of SST in modern subduction zones, this work will test (a) whether SST may be preferentially accommodated by metasedimentary or meta-mafic lithologies, and (b) how structural heterogeneity along the subduction interface affects the spatial distribution of SST. The outcomes of this work will have implications for the geologic conditions and slip behavior at the base of the seismogenic zone and will therefore better inform both SST observations in active subduction zones and geodynamic models of the seismic cycle and associated earthquake hazards.

    "abstractText": "The frequency of wildfires has increased rapidly in recent decades and is projected to increase in the future. Among the many impacts of wildfires on society and the environment, there is growing evidence that wildfires alter forest vegetation and soil in ways that enhance the spread of debris and chemical contaminants in the environment. This leads to increased contamination of lakes, rivers, and groundwater. Unfortunately, when wildfire contaminants enter drinking water supplies, they can react with disinfectants used to treat drinking water and form harmful disinfection by-products (DPBs).  The goal of this project is to address this gap in our understanding of how wildfire impacts the formation of DBPs through a combination of laboratory and field experiments. Researchers will characterize the organic and inorganic material present in forests during wildfires and assess how these compounds affect the formation of DBPs when released into water bodies. The successful completion of this research will benefit society by advancing fundamental knowledge about the impacts of wildfires on water disinfection processes and water quality. The findings of this research will be shared with stakeholders to implement effective mitigation strategies for wildfires. Further benefits to society will be achieved by training undergraduate and graduate students at the University of South Carolina to increase the STEM workforce.    Combustion processes during wildfire alter the properties of organic matter and metals, leading to enhanced formation of DBPs during drinking water treatment of impacted waters. However, the relationships between the severity of wildfires and the transformation and mobility of metals, the levels and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and enhanced formation of DBPs in drinking water sources remain unclear. To address these knowledge gaps, investigators will conduct a combined field and laboratory study to: (1) Characterize the wildfire-induced metal transformations in field-collected ashes, soils, and forest litter under laboratory-controlled experiments; (2) Determine the concentrations of metals and DOM levels and composition in simulated runoff and streams from the burned area; and (3) Investigate the formation of DBPs through controlled laboratory chlorination and chloramination of ash, soil, and water leachates. This research will improve the fundamental understanding of the real-world implications of wildfires by conducting planned moderate- and high-severity burns that allow for the collection of \u201cbefore and after\u201d fire samples. Both watershed-scale studies and laboratory experiments combining nontarget and target analysis of metals and organic matter will be used to create realistic predictions of real-world fires. Together, these results may facilitate the discovery of unexpected organic and inorganic compounds in the fire ash, soil, and water samples post wildfire events.

    "abstractText": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a food protein production platform aimed at reducing the environmental impact of livestock farming. Current livestock farming practices have a significant negative impact on the environment, human health, and sustainability, contributing 15% of human-driven greenhouse gas emissions and consuming one-third of all agricultural water and land for livestock feed crops. Additional negative consequences of animal agriculture include pesticide runoff, eutrophication, water resource contamination, and the propagation of antibiotic resistance. This project seeks to mitigate these effects by enhancing an alternative means of food production, precision fermentation, or the process of using microbial hosts as cellular factories for the production of specific proteins. The platform proposed in this project will enhance precision fermentation methods by accelerating the development of new strains, enabling the high-yield production of a range of food proteins.    The proposed project leverages machine learning and experimental biology to accelerate the industrial-scale production of animal protein in yeast. The current discovery and development process for yeast production strains is expensive (>$50 million) and slow (6-8 years), constrained by the limitations of existing technology in predicting strain performance. The proposed platform overcomes this limitation using a high-throughput approach for screening millions of signal sequences and target protein combinations, and a novel application of machine learning for the rapid prediction and design of signal sequences with high secretion potential. The insights derived from these analyses may guide genetic engineering efforts for the development of custom, optimized, and efficient strains for specific applications in precision fermentation. This project is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of this approach by 1) developing a high-throughput sequence screen for high-expression proteins and signal peptides, 2) training an artificial intelligence model to predict high-performing signal peptides and signal peptide-target protein pairs, and 3) constructing high-yield strains.

    "abstractText": "Human beings constantly change the way they speak. Discovering how and why people change their speech is key to understanding knowledge of language. Previous research has shown that people quickly change their way of speaking when they talk to one another, in a phenomenon known as phonetic accommodation. People may also quickly change the way they speak and listen to their first language (L1) when they learn a second language (L2), in a process called phonetic drift. While these two processes of speech change may be connected, they have not yet been studied in tandem. This doctoral dissertation project investigates both how bilingual speakers adjust their L2 when exposed to a person who speaks a different variety of the L2, and how this experience affects the bilingual speaker\u2019s L1. Because previous research has largely focused on native speakers or on nonnative speakers who learned their L2 later in life, this project instead examines nonnative speakers who learned their L2 early in life \u2013 early bilinguals. Early bilinguals are of scientific interest because they show similarities to native speakers but also to nonnative speakers. This project gathers experimental data on speech production and perception in early bilinguals during interactions with another speaker. The findings contribute to a scientific understanding of how sound changes occur in bilingual individuals and have implications for research on the bilingual brain. This project also benefits society by providing educational opportunities and workforce development skills for students.    Bilingual people who learn a second language (L2) early and use it regularly in daily life raise key questions about what shapes bilingual speech. Some early bilingual speakers, despite their similarities to native speakers, show differences in how their first language (L1) influences their L2. This doctoral dissertation project tests theories of L2 production and perception by examining within-speaker language and dialect change across two bilingual populations, each with a distinct L1 background, living in different language environments. The project advances three aims: (1) to analyze how bilingual speakers modify their L2 speech production when exposed to a foreign variety of that language (i.e., L2 phonetic accommodation), (2) to identify short-term changes in L1 speech production following L2 phonetic accommodation (i.e., L1 production drift), and (3) to investigate short-term changes in L1 speech perception following L2 phonetic accommodation (i.e., L1 perceptual drift) along with the relationship between perception and production changes. By comparing groups with different L1 backgrounds and language environments, the project provides insight into the roles of linguistic background and ambient language context in L2 phonetic accommodation and L1 phonetic drift. Participants are early bilingual speakers in two distinct environments. Demographic data comes from a background questionnaire, and acoustic and perceptual data from a series of production and perception tasks (e.g., picture naming, shadowing, forced-choice identification). The results contribute to a broader understanding of bilingual phonetics, the dynamics of cross-linguistic influence, and the factors shaping language change in bilingual populations.

    "abstractText": "This project serves the national interest by holding two workshops to develop and refine a self-assessment tool for mathematics departments at research universities.  The project-developed assessment will enable departments to increase their student success and graduation rates by improving teaching and learning in undergraduate mathematics courses. This tool will be developed in partnership with teams from three large Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs): Florida International University, San Diego State University, and the University of Texas San Antonio. The mathematics departments at these partner institutions will also serve as pilot and testing sites for the new tool. The project has three phases.  First, through the initial workshop and virtual collaborations, an expert writing team will work with departmental teams to adapt existing assessments that have been used effectively in other disciplines and at other types of institutions. Next, departmental leaders from the three partnering HSIs will use the self-assessment to explore how several proven strategies are being utilized in undergraduate mathematics courses at each site. Finally, the project team and participants will come together for a closing workshop to discuss lessons learned, revisions to the tool, and next steps. The current project is part of the larger Eliminating the Math Barrier through Evidence-based Reforms (EMBER) initiative which seeks to engage 100 institutions in deploying established student success strategies.    The planned self-assessment will examine placement, course structures, course coordination, active pedagogies, student support, creating community, advising, technology, data on student progress, student assessment, classroom teacher development and client department needs. While this project will explore specific aspects of effective self-assessment at Hispanic Serving Research Universities (HSRUs), the tools developed will be applicable across institution types.  Development of the self-assessment will build on existing tools and self-assessment practices, including those used in American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges\u2019 (AMATYC\u2019s) Teaching for Prowess, Effective Practices for Physics Programs, the Departmental Action Team model, the MAA's Guidelines for Programs and Departments, and American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) STEMM Equity Achievement (SEA) Change initiative.  The three collaborating HSIs will examine their campus student success as part of the program self-assessment exercise. The department teams will disaggregate data whenever possible, allowing for the identification of challenges and gaps within and across groups of students. Key to the work will be teaching-focused faculty, who now coordinate instruction for most introductory mathematics courses at research institutions. As part of the piloting process, each institution will subsequently consider an action plan. The closing workshop will showcase each team's work, continue building collaboration, and gather feedback about the self-assessment with the goal of further developing the self-assessment for broader use. Lessons learned will be shared with the mathematics community and other disciplinary groups interested in exploring similar vehicles for departmental assessment and change.

These range from military and security settings, to auctions, to networks. Developing technology to find optimal behavior\u2014also known as equilibrium\u2014in these interactions has the potential of enabling more economically efficient auctions, enhance strategic reasoning in situations of conflict, and improve our ability to predict the evolution of complex multiagent systems.

    "abstractText": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be improvement of the health and welfare of Americans by providing an efficient and cost-effective approach for developing therapeutics for previously undruggable diseases, including hard to treat neurodegenerative diseases and highly aggressive cancers. Most diseases are targeted at the protein level using small molecule drugs, but only 600 proteins have ever been drugged directly.  This collective human effort has left the majority of roughly 3,000 disease-related genes in humans undrugged and unable to be drugged using conventional pharmaceutical technology. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) lie upstream of protein expression and, in principle, can be targeted to modulate protein function and treat disease. However, the physical and chemical properties of mRNAs present unique challenges not faced during protein-based drug discovery, and there has been little success in targeting mRNAs using small molecules. This project will address this unmet need by developing small molecule drugs against hard to treat and previously undruggable diseases by targeting their mRNAs directly.     The proposed project will enable critical technical innovations needed to ensure the technical and commercial viability of a nascent drug discovery platform making it high-throughput and cost effective. The high throughput drug discovery platform to be developed creates an efficient path to screen for high-value drug assets and creates multiple pathways to new classes of therapeutics. The drug discovery platform currently has outstanding robustness and accuracy in defining interactions between small molecules and mRNAs in cells. However, the platform includes bespoke and hands-on steps and will remain a research-lab-only tool without critical innovations. The proposed project will improve the platform to be capable of fully automated ligand screening in cells using a library of complex small molecules optimized to bind mRNA. Methods will be developed to screen multiplexed samples, in a quantitative way. Automation will require the integration of diverse, novel methodologies, and data deconvolution.

    "abstractText": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly a part of everyday life for functional purposes (like interpreting x-rays or recommending entertainment), and also for companionship (like chatting or even just sitting together). Companionship is a positive state of close connection with someone or something that unfolds over time and is valued for itself. Companionship is important to human life because it enhances well-being---for instance through reduced loneliness, enhanced emotional resilience, and finding elevated meaning in life. Evidence shows that people can see AI agents as mindful entities, and scientists and technologists often assume that creating more human-like, seemingly mindful AI, is necessary to foster companionship benefits. However, there are no scientific studies demonstrating that seeing a machine as a \u201csomeone\u201d actually enables or enhances companionship benefits. Without a full understanding of the link between machine-mind perception and companionship outcomes, we may be developing and using technologies that carry unnecessary risks to privacy and may even diminish well-being. This project determines how to best measure the notion of mind perception, companionship, and well-being in human-AI relations. A series of studies then assesses the assumed link between perceiving AI systems as mindful entities and their efficacy as companions across different kinds of AI applications. By answering the fundamental question of whether mind perception plays a role in AI-companionship benefits, the work will ultimately help technologists make better decisions about AI design, public health officials make better decisions about AI policies, and everyday users make better decisions about whether and how they want to interact with AI companions.    To accomplish the desired outcomes, the project pursues three objectives: 1) Develop and validate measurements for AI mind perception, companionship, and relational benefits; 2) build a data-driven model of relationships between those variables; and 3) test the model in short- and long-term human-AI relations. Objective 1 will be achieved by analyzing public conversations about AI companions, generating and evaluating self-report measurement tools, validating existing measurements for use in human-AI contexts, and exploring behavioral indicators of mind perception, companionship, and well-being. Objective 2 will be achieved through studies designed to identify direct or indirect relationships between mind perception, companionship, and well-being\u2014experiments test the causal influence of mind perception on companionship experiences and subjective well-being. Objective 3 will be achieved by longitudinally testing the identified causal effects (via real-time surveys of experience) over short-term and long-term companionship interactions. This work advances the science of social-psychological processes and AI companionship. It comes at a time when companionship, as a key component in fulfilled human life, is increasingly addressed by social AI. This project lays the evidential groundwork to determine whether and how current theories of human mind perception apply to AI companionship. The research advances understanding of whether or not we must see someone in the machine for them to meaningfully contribute to human well-being.

    "abstractText": "Non-Technical Summary   A hydrogel is a three-dimensional, sponge-like material that can hold a large amount of water. Hydrogels with complex microstructures have become a promising type of material because they offer unique advantages compared to traditional, uniform hydrogels. However, making these advanced hydrogels often requires complicated and time-consuming steps, such as creating and packaging tiny gel particles using methods like microfluidics or water-and-oil mixtures. These techniques can be unsuitable for biological applications and often require additional cleaning processes. This NSF CAREER project aims to develop a simpler and more efficient way to create structured hydrogels using a sugar-based material system and a natural process called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) \u2013 a phenomenon similar to how oil and vinegar separate in salad dressing. This novel approach uses chemical modifications to design hydrogels with customizable microstructures that vary in shape, size, and stiffness, enabling scientists to better understand how these material structures affect mechanical properties and cell behavior. Advanced tools like chemical analytical equipment and powerful microscopes will help reveal how the gel\u2019s structure affects its strength and interactions with cells. Unlike current methods, this new process avoids harmful chemicals, simplifies production, and supports the creation of more complex hydrogel designs. Additionally, this research includes educational efforts to teach and train students and researchers how to combine principles of chemical engineering and bioengineering to develop innovative materials for applications such as medicine and tissue repair.    Technical Summary   Microstructured hydrogels have emerged as a promising class of biomaterials due to their distinct advantages over conventional bulk hydrogels. However, current methods for producing microparticle hydrogels often involve complex, multi-step processes, such as microgel formulation and encapsulation, using techniques like microfluidics and bulk emulsions that rely on water/oil emulsions. This NSF CAREER proposal aims to develop an innovative bottom-up approach to engineer liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a polysaccharide-based biocomposite material system. This approach leverages versatile chemical crosslinking reactions to produce a library of hydrogels with tunable microstructural morphologies and mechanical heterogeneity, enabling the investigation of their impact on cellular behavior. Analytical chemistry, multiscale mechanical analysis, and confocal microscopic characterizations are employed to elucidate fundamental relationships between hydrogel network structure, material properties, and cellular interactions. The proposed de novo engineered LLPS technique offers a simplified process that eliminates the need for organic solvent while enhancing structural complexity. This work strives to provide a fundamental and generalizable understanding of structural-property-performance relationships in hydrogels. Finally, the educational plan capitalizes on the interdisciplinary nature of the research by providing comprehensive demonstrations and training, fostering the integration of chemical engineering and bioengineering principles in biomaterials design.

    "abstractText": "The past few decades have seen tremendous advances in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution using both observations and detailed computer simulations. However, many key questions are still not fully understood. For example, most massive elliptical galaxies, among the oldest and most massive structures in the universe and hosts of supermassive black holes (SMBH), cease forming stars and transition into passively evolving systems. While the precise mechanisms underpinning such \"quenching\" are unclear, SMBHs appear to play a key role by suppressing the infall of fresh gas - the raw material of star formation - from the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The PI will conduct a computer simulation of a massive galaxy's formation and evolution with spatial resolution sufficient to resolve the CGM's complex structure and the small-scale physical processes occurring there. This work will inform and complement large-scale cosmological simulations and will provide mentoring and training for three graduate students in cutting edge galaxy simulations. Undergraduate students will also be involved, and the investigator will engage in outreach to local high schools and public planetarium shows.     To better understand the evolution of massive galaxies, the investigator and her group will conduct a very high- resolution numerical study using a cosmological-zoom simulation focusing on the formation of a single massive galaxy while following its evolution all the way down to the current epoch (z = 0). The major objectives of this work are to understand (1) how SMBHs form and grow in massive galaxies, (2) precisely how SMBH \"feedback\" leads to star formation quenching, (3) the structure and evolution the CGM, and (4) how the evolution of satellite galaxies is affected. The team will use the newly developed Enzo-E, which is a highly scalable redesign of the original Enzo code for the exascale era. They will develop a new state-of-the-art SMBH formation/feedback model, which will be added to the publicly available code and shared with the community. The proposed simulations will force enhanced refinement in the galaxy's CGM, providing unprecedented details of this major gas reservoir around massive galaxies, which likely plays a key role in regulating the fueling of both SMBHs and star formation. This research will provide insight into the complex interplay between SMBHs, the CGM, and star formation in a massive galaxy, and it will provide a framework for simulating the effects of (e.g.) cosmic rays, dust, and radiative transfer.

    "abstractText": "Non-technical abstract  Osteoporosis, trauma, severe inflammation, and the removal of bone cancer tumors can lead to large bone defects that exceed the self-healing capacity of human bones. Bone graft surgery, which involves transplanting healthy bone tissues from the patient or a donor to the damaged area, is the gold standard for treating these defects. In the U.S., approximately 600,000 bone grafts are performed annually, making bone the second most transplanted tissue after blood. However, bone grafts come with risks, including infection at the donor site, restrictions on graft size, limited tissue availability, and the potential for immune rejection and pathogen transmission. An alternative approach, bone tissue engineering, can create transplantable bone substitutes by growing healthy tissues from the patient\u2019s own mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on implantable biomaterials. However, MSCs can differentiate into various cell types beyond bone, including cartilage, muscle, tendon, and vascular cells.  Thus, advanced biomaterials are needed to promote MSC growth while guiding their differentiation specifically into bone-forming cells. This NSF CAREER project aims to develop a novel magnetically responsive biomaterial that can replicate the microstructures and physical stimuli of natural human bones. To achieve this, the biomaterial will be printed into three-dimensional porous biological scaffolds, offering a large surface area for cell attachment and micro-channels for nutrient delivery. Additionally, this biomaterial will exhibit changes in stiffness, mechanically deform, and generate electricity in response to magnetic field excitations. These dynamic properties closely mimic the critical stimuli offered by natural bones. Leveraging these unique properties, this study will investigate the use of magnetic fields to control the growth and differentiation of MSCs. To foster the growth of Idaho's scientific workforce, an integrated education plan will provide professional development opportunities for local high school teachers, establish project-based science curricula for high school students, and create hands-on, service-learning courses for college students.    Technical Abstract  This CAREER project aims to revolutionize bone defect treatment by developing a transformative magnetoelectric biomaterial replicating the complex mechanobiological environments in human bones. This functional biomaterial, made of magnetostrictive terbium-iron-dysprosium nanoparticles dispersed in a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride polymer matrix, can generate precise, nonintrusive mechanical cues through two unique mechanisms: the Delta-E effect, mimicking elasticity variations during bone growth, and the magnetoelectric effect, mimicking mechanical vibrations and piezoelectric stimuli found in bones. However, magnetoelectric biomaterials are still nascent in bone tissue engineering, as early studies have been limited to two-dimensional bioscaffolds with inconsistent material properties and unproven efficacy. By integrating additive manufacturing, multiphysics material characterization, and in vitro testing, three key research objectives will be pursued in this project: (1) Print three-dimensional magnetoelectric bioscaffolds that mimic the porous morphology and mechanical strength of human bones, (2) characterize the Delta-E effect in these bioscaffolds and assess its efficacy in controlling stem cell behavior, and (3) explore the magnetoelectric effect from these bioscaffolds and elucidate its efficacy in regulating stem cell behavior. An integrated education plan will train high school teachers in smart material nanosynthesis, additive manufacturing, and multiphysics material characterization, helping them enrich their classrooms with cutting-edge science topics. Furthermore, by creating project-based curricula at local high schools and introducing hands-on, service-learning courses at Boise State, the team will establish a collaborative platform, enabling local high school students, their teachers, and college students to work together on bioscaffold design, fabrication, and validation, thereby enhancing student engagement in science and technology.

    "abstractText": "The extraordinary advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been demonstrated in various aspects of our lives, from healthcare to transportation. However, the ever-growing capability of AI is accompanied by an exponential increase in computational complexity, leading to unprecedented energy consumption and ever-growing demand for computing/memory resources. As a result, developing efficient and scalable intelligent hardware systems is critical for (1) addressing the environmental and sustainability implications of AI computation and (2) enabling broad adoption of AI to improve the productivity and economic competitiveness of our society. One promising direction for developing efficient AI computing systems is to exploit stochasticity (randomness) to process the various statistical learning models. However, the hardware implementation of truly-random functionality on standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) components lacks efficiency due to significant area and power overheads. Moreover, the conventional approach of incorporating stochasticity for brain-inspired computing focuses on cell-level emulations of neurons and synapses, facing significant challenges in scalability. In this project, a novel system architecture with emerging devices/circuits will be developed to create intelligent computing systems based on ensembles of stochastic processing elements. The knowledge on designing scalable and robust AI computing systems created from this project will be disseminated to a broader community of our society through a multi-level portfolio of educational efforts. Such educational efforts are designed to advance AI literacy among a population with diverse backgrounds and cultivate a strong future workforce with cross-disciplinary expertise in AI and microelectronics.     To accelerate various critical AI operations from matrix-vector multiplications to softmax in the attention layer, device-architecture-system cross-layer co-optimization will be conducted to integrate spintronics with intrinsic stochasticity and deterministic silicon components into energy-efficient non-von Neumann computing systems. Next, ensemble-based hardware-aware computational models will be developed to enable such novel hardware fabrics for large-scale learning tasks. Furthermore, this project will design a unified and versatile hardware platform that supports a broad range of AI applications, including deep neural networks and emerging neuro-symbolic models. Such development will tackle the long-standing challenges of scalability and flexibility associated with stochastic computation and create a new venue for developing next-generation versatile intelligent computing systems.

GRMI will provide undergraduate students with an interdisciplinary research experience in the Gulf of Maine. The primary objective of the GMRI program is to train the next generation of scientists capable of describing, quantifying and communicating the interconnections between environmental and human influences on marine ecosystems. The GMRI REU students are exposed to multiple scientific approaches, including classic experimental ecology, observational science, qualitative analyses and statistical and dynamical modeling. Students can choose to work with a broad range of mentors who are active in marine fisheries and coastal ecology and dynamics, biological oceanography, resource economics, climate resilience, and the learning sciences. Applications are encouraged from students attending colleges with limited research opportunities, such as two-year and four-year primarily undergraduate institutions, veterans and first-generation students.    REU students at GMRI explore the structure and function of the Gulf of Maine fishery ecosystem (plankton to seafood), how it is changing over time (trends and prediction), how it responds to perturbations (e.g., climate and fishing), and how changes may affect local communities and economies. They develop independent, hypothesis-driven research projects and are exposed to multiple scientific approaches, including classic experimental ecology, observational science, and statistical and dynamical modeling. Students also receive training for research safety and ethics and participate in workshops about data management, data analysis and scientific communications. These, along with social activities, a journal club, regular seminars and a student symposium to share results are designed to foster a sense of shared experiences, critical to the success of the program. Student research will contribute to an ecosystem approach to marine resource management in a rapidly changing environment, lessons from which can be applied to other coupled systems around the world.

    "abstractText": "Many currently unresolved combinatorial optimization problems can be mapped into large-scale Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Solving these problems can lead to breakthroughs in various disciplines including medicine, finance, and engineering, among others. Unfortunately, traditional computing systems based on von Neumann architectures struggle to accurately solve QUBO problems involving more than a few tens of variables. This limitation has spurred academia and industry to seek alternative methods for addressing large-scale QUBO problems. Recently, this effort has driven considerable interest in analog computing systems known as Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs). OIMs use oscillating physical devices as artificial binary spins and offer high parallelization during the computation. However, current OIMs consume significant power per spin, and their accuracy in solving QUBO problems decays sharply as the problem size grows, which is primarily due to amplitude heterogeneity (AH), a phenomenon that disrupts the dynamics of large analog spin networks. In practice, AH limits the ability of OIMs to find correct solutions for QUBO problems with more than hundred variables. This project will create \u201cn-SPHERE\u201d (multidimeNSional comPlementary metal-oxide-semiconductor HypERspin programmablE circuits), a new solver for combinatorial optimization problems manufacturable in CMOS technology. The project team will collaborate with the STEM education and workforce development program at Northeastern University to organize on-campus activities involving K-12 students, community colleges, and local schools, focusing on enhancing STEM engagement, particularly among underrepresented groups.    This research will form a new foundation for analog computing by generating a chip-scale computing engine that successfully solves QUBO problems with thousands of variables while consuming power levels in the microwatt range. n-SPHERE will surpass previous OIMs by utilizing novel spin-network dynamics and advanced nonlinear circuit designs. It will prevent performance degradation due to AH by employing CMOS circuits that mimic the behavior of multidimensional hyperspins and by implementing a new annealing technique, called dimensional annealing, during the computation. When addressing QUBO problems with thousands of variables, n-SPHERE is expected to achieve a probability of success and time-to-solution two orders of magnitude better than current OIMs. In addition, n-SPHERE will consume over ten times less power per spin compared to the existing QUBO solvers. This capability will produce new computational resources for exploring and leveraging emerging phenomena in a variety of disciplines.

    "abstractText": "Computing\u2019s carbon footprint is growing at an unsustainable rate. To overcome this global challenge, researchers and professionals are exploring techniques to reduce the total carbon footprint of computing systems across their entire lifetime, considering both embodied carbon (due to emissions during manufacturing) and operational carbon (from day-to-day use.) This represents a paradigm shift in humanity\u2019s approach to designing computing systems, evolving from energy-efficient design (balancing performance and energy consumption) to carbon-efficient design (balancing performance and total carbon footprint). While today\u2019s efforts in carbon-efficient computing are essential, many of them focus on today\u2019s silicon-based technologies, and thus do not fully capture the wide range of future beyond-silicon technologies that are actively being investigated for future directions in energy-efficient computing. In particular, monolithic three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs), which have multiple layers of computing and memory circuits densely integrated directly on top of each other in three dimensions, are unmatched in their projected energy efficiency benefits. However, their implications on computing\u2019s carbon footprint are not as well understood. This project aims to answer the following question: should monolithic 3D ICs be pursued for carbon-efficient computing, considering trade-offs in power, performance, area, operational carbon, and embodied carbon? This project also emphases two key goals in education. The first is to leverage recent developments in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to help students visualize complex manufacturing processes for monolithic 3D ICs. The second is to instill the idea that carbon footprint is a first-class figure of merit for computing systems, alongside conventional metrics including power, performance, and area.     This project focuses on addressing three key challenges. Challenge 1: quantifying the embodied carbon footprint of future monolithic 3D ICs, as opposed to silicon-based ICs that are already commercially available, is particularly difficult for manufacturing processes that are not yet in production. Challenge 2: it is not clear which metrics (or figures of merit) designers should target for optimizing carbon efficiency, instead of energy efficiency. Challenge 3: there is high variability in quantifying carbon footprint, due to both (a) transparency: designers may not have full access to detailed carbon emission numbers from manufacturing, and (b) varying energy sources: the carbon footprint of executing a computing task varies depending on the energy source (for example, renewable versus non-renewable), which also changes over time. The technical approach is organized across four research thrusts designed to address these three key challenges. Thrust 1: Modeling embodied carbon of monolithic 3D ICs comprising emerging beyond-silicon nanotechnologies. Thrust 2: Analyzing metrics of carbon efficiency to drive carbon-aware optimization. Thrust 3: Developing case studies in carbon-efficient computing. Thrust 4: Leveraging mathematical robust optimization techniques to design carbon-efficient computing systems even when there is uncertainty in carbon accounting.

Modern applications, such as online advertising, data center management, and ride-sharing operate on a massive scale, necessitating algorithms that learn from historical data, remain robust to outliers and corruptions, and adapt to diverse and dynamic scenarios. This project seeks to tackle these key technical challenges by developing innovative and effective solutions that will expand the boundaries of existing theory, address critical knowledge gaps, and pave the way for new innovations in online resource allocation. In addition to closely advising graduate students and developing curriculum, the educational components of this project include organizing a summer school on online algorithms, auction design, and data-driven algorithms, preparing a comprehensive textbook on Online Decision Making, and hosting a research workshop featuring invited talks from leading experts in academia and industry.

To better understand the evolution of massive galaxies, the investigator and her group will conduct a very high- resolution numerical study using a cosmological-zoom simulation focusing on the formation of a single massive galaxy while following its evolution all the way down to the current epoch (z = 0). The major objectives of this work are to understand (1) how SMBHs form and grow in massive galaxies, (2) precisely how SMBH \"feedback\" leads to star formation quenching, (3) the structure and evolution the CGM, and (4) how the evolution of satellite galaxies is affected. The team will use the newly developed Enzo-E, which is a highly scalable redesign of the original Enzo code for the exascale era. They will develop a new state-of-the-art SMBH formation/feedback model, which will be added to the publicly available code and shared with the community. The proposed simulations will force enhanced refinement in the galaxy's CGM, providing unprecedented details of this major gas reservoir around massive galaxies, which likely plays a key role in regulating the fueling of both SMBHs and star formation. This research will provide insight into the complex interplay between SMBHs, the CGM, and star formation in a massive galaxy, and it will provide a framework for simulating the effects of (e.g.) cosmic rays, dust, and radiative transfer.

The ship was originally designed as a stern trawler and was used for twelve years as a fishing vessel on the Grand Banks. The ship was bought from its original owner and refitted for oceanographic research in 1997-98, using funds provided by the National Science Foundation and the State of Minnesota. It has operated in this capacity ever since. Access to the Blue Heron is open to scientists from any institution at a cost that is based on annual operating expenses (both ship operations and technical services) of the vessel divided by the number of operating days in the calendar year.     The University of Minnesota, Duluth (UMD) proposes to support oceanographic technical services on R/V Blue Heron operated as part of the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF), which is scheduled by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). As part of their basic operations, UMD will provide shipboard technicians on each seagoing research project to support basic services. Technicians will maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users, items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.

    "abstractText": "Lakes can undergo rapid and sustained changes in water quality. These changes, often referred to as regime shifts, can substantially alter the lake environment, including food webs. Regime shifts often occur when conditions cross tipping points, but understanding the feedbacks and attributes that lead to regime shifts can be challenging. Increases in dissolved organic matter in lake water, termed lake browning, are occurring in many regions. Dissolved organic matter regulates water clarity, water temperature, ecosystem respiration, and many other lake attributes, suggesting potentially long-term and substantial impacts. Lake browning may stimulate lake dissolved oxygen losses, termed deoxygenation, that leads to further increases in dissolved organic matter and nutrients, ultimately resulting in sustained water quality impairment. This project seeks to understand the impacts of an anticipated lake regime shift driven by increases in dissolved organic matter and its impact on the lake overall. There may be tipping points associated with the low dissolved oxygen in lake bottom waters, driven by the increases in dissolved organic matter. Broader impacts include undergraduate student research experiences and community outreach activities.     Using a sophisticated suite of sensors, manually-collected long-term data spanning multiple decades, experiments, and ecosystem models will help discern the consequences of lake browning and low dissolved oxygen availability in lakes. Studying multiple lakes that vary in dissolved organic matter, nutrients, and oxygen availability will provide the capacity to compare and assess feedbacks and tipping points resulting from rapid increases in dissolved organic matter that may push water quality conditions toward several potential future trajectories. This research will provide a foundation to understand the implications of widespread aquatic deoxygenation through research and data publications and training of early career scientists in the use of sophisticated sensors and other technologies. This project will extend a long-term data set of water quality variables sampled since the late 1980s of Lakes Lacawac and Giles in or near the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station, located in northeastern Pennsylvania.

    "abstractText": "This project aims to serve the national interest to improve undergraduate STEM education by examining the status and trajectory of Discipline-Based Education Research.  In 2012, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report entitled Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER): Understanding and Improving Learning in Undergraduate Science and Engineering that outlined the promise of DBER in improving STEM education and made recommendations for advancing the field.  The proposed project is intended as a follow-up to the 2012 study, to examine the current state of affairs in DBER.  Significant progress has been made in recognizing and developing DBER as a field of study, with DBER scholars embedded in a variety of departments and translation of DBER findings into undergraduate STEM teaching practices.  The proposed project intends to systematically examine the work accomplished since the release of the initial report, with the intention of articulating progress, identifying gaps in research and application of knowledge, and illuminating points of convergence and divergence between different disciplines engaged in DBER.    The National Academies will convene a planning committee composed of approximately seven members with a broad understanding of the issues related to DBER, including professional learning, higher education administration, research administration, and institutional change.  Through a series of meetings, the planning committee will create a list of potential topics to be covered in a larger workshop, as well as identify potential speakers, panelists, and discussants.  A public workshop will be held in Washington DC, with potential attendees spanning a range of disciplines, institution types, career stages, and expertise.  To increase accessibility, the workshop will be live-streamed, enabling virtual participation by individuals unable to attend in person.  Workshop proceeding will be gathered, edited, and posted to the National Academies website and a public webinar will be held to discuss the main points identified in the workshop.

    "abstractText": "This project serves the national interest by working to broaden participation of students from a breadth of populations in the mathematical sciences. Specifically, this project will organize the 2025 Annual Gulf States Math Alliance (GSMATH) Conference and offer a faculty development workshop to support the use of collaborative mentoring strategies by mathematics faculty at participating institutions. The GSMATH Conference will be held at Southern University New Orleans from February 14 - 16, 2025. The conference is organized by GSMATH, which is the regional mathematics alliance covering the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. GSMATH includes an active and strong network of faculty mentors in over 25 HSIs (Hispanic Serving Institutions), HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), and other institutions that serve a breadth of student populations. Building from prior GSMATH conferences, it is anticipated that over 100 students and 50 faculty will attend the conference. Student sessions will center on demystifying pathways through undergraduate degree programs in the mathematical sciences. Keynote speakers, panel discussions, a student poster session, and a graduate school fair will provide multiple opportunities for students to network, ask questions, and receive mentoring. The faculty workshop will focus on supporting students as they transition from 2-year and 4-year colleges into graduate education or the workforce.    The GSMATH conference will directly contribute to efforts to broaden participation and support students' knowledge of educational and career pathways in the mathematical sciences. This, in turn, has potential to improve STEM education and academic outcomes for students across disciplines. Panels such as \"What I wish I knew Before Graduate School,\" \"Non-Academic Math Careers,\" and an undergraduate-graduate student dialogue, will enable participating students to get advice from faculty and experienced peers. The involvement of community college (CC) mathematics faculty and students is a critical element of the GSMATH conference, as 2-year colleges are a starting point for many students pursuing bachelor\u2019s and graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences. The faculty development workshop will not only present an opportunity for faculty to collaboratively mentor those students throughout the year but will also address critical transition points from CCs to four-year institutions and from undergraduate to graduate studies. Faculty development will also strengthen connections among participating institutions, supporting the growth of a responsive community of mentors across the discipline. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.

    "abstractText": "This project investigates the motivations for humans to adopt farming as a livelihood strategy. The development of lifeways centered on farming represent the most important economic transition in human history. For over a century, scholars have debated the relative costs and benefits of this transition with ramifications that include the advent of private property, the scale and structure of human communities, and the division of labor among different groups in society. One view holds that groups were pushed into farming with its higher labor demands due to environmental downturns or demographic pressure. An alternative view is that groups were drawn to farming due to its overall greater productive potential, more predictable yields, and increased potential for producers to control surplus production. These discussions are clouded by assumptions about the level of intentionality and foresight held by the earliest people to adopt of farming. This project addresses these issues by focusing on a context in which the spread of agriculture paused for an extended period of time before rapidly accelerating coincident with environmental change. The people responsible for the further spread of agriculture had ample opportunity to observe long term ramifications. Reconstructing the ecological contexts of this spread clarifies whether adoption of farming occurred under duress or by choice when it was ecologically viable.  The project includes broader impacts through training opportunities provided in STEM fields to students, the fostering of scientific partnerships, and planned outreach activities in host communities.    Three primary research sites are being investigated, these span diverse ecological contexts and correspond to the first known sites of farmers in the region. Archaeological excavations, assess the relative commitment to domesticated plants and their wild forerunners as evidenced by plant processing equipment. Excavations also clarify the pace of the spread of farming by analysis of radiocarbon dated plant material. Another focus of the project is to reconstruct the environmental conditions during the adoption of farming with an emphasis on seasonal rainfall patterns. This is accomplished through studies of carbonate minerals with isotopic ratios reflecting the source of rainfall and the water temperature in which the carbonate formed. Additional environmental reconstructions methods include paleobotany, pollen, and sediment analysis.

    "abstractText": "This project aims to serves the national interest by supporting a conference to share knowledge and strategies for improving undergraduate STEM education.  Given the changing nature of higher education (e.g., new enrollment patterns, an increased focus on students' mental health and wellbeing, greater financial and economic challenges, broader opportunities for increasing economic mobility), it is imperative that those working to create and sustain positive change consider how these broader shifts will impact undergraduate STEM education. Achieving transformative change in higher education requires understanding multiple perspectives and ensuring that change agents are all pushing in the same direction. The current STEM education reform movement has successfully engaged a large community of faculty and academic administrators but has not yet meaningfully incorporated those who work in student services at universities or those who work in university business and planning offices. To be effective, greater communication and collaboration is needed within and across organizations focused on improving undergraduate STEM education. The conference aims to bring new and different perspectives into the conversation about how to accelerate systemic change in STEM in order to inspire and support change agents and researchers to engage in this work.     The conference seeks to integrate perspectives from three core functional areas within institutions of higher education: financial management, student affairs, and academic affairs. The theme for the conference will be Taking a Multi-Perspective Approach to Systemic Change in Undergraduate STEM Education. The goal is to bring together different groups of people who seek to create positive and sustained change in undergraduate STEM education. Communities represented in the conference will include STEM education transformation researchers and change agents, higher education student services professionals, and higher education business and planning professionals. A particular focus will be on how these different communities can work together to accelerate systemic change in STEM. The conference format is to be designed to purposefully foster participant interaction across the different areas and perspectives represented. A website will host conference presentations and other conference materials. The website will remain accessible to the public to support continued connections and collaborations.

    "abstractText": "Research Activity Identifier (RAiD) is a new digital persistent identifier (PID) specifically for research projects and activities, developed by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). RAiD provides unique, digital persistent identifiers with corresponding metadata for research projects. This is especially helpful for long-term discovery, resolution, access, sharing, reporting and tracking of the researchers, resources, funding, and associated outputs of projects with multiple stakeholders over time. Based on international standards and guidelines, RAiD provides a transparent, visible, and reliable collection point for often overlooked or lost project information, even after closure, and helps to alleviate the administrative burden of risk-prone and repetitive manual entry of extensive data by multiple researchers when preparing research applications, submissions, funding requests, subproject allocations, project collaborations, and research reports. Currently there is no way for institutions in the United States to use RAiD, although interest has been expressed by stakeholders across the research ecosystem, including the Center for Open Science, health research funders, universities, cyberinfrastructure providers, multi-institution research projects, and individual researchers.    This effort facilitates development of cyberinfrastructure for a hosted cloud service for a US Research Activity Identifier registration agency, a web application and API for minting RAiDs, and a business model and process for providing a RAiD service point for US-based entities.  It builds upon and leverages existing expertise and resources at an NSF-funded advanced computing center, a national research data organization, and a robust nonprofit already providing PID infrastructure services for institutional members of ORCID and DataCite in the US.

    "abstractText": "This U.S.-French joint research project addresses the growing interest in modeling, analyzing, and generating 3D shapes and movements of human bodies and faces. Advances in scanning technology, 3D mesh-extraction algorithms, computer vision, and hardware-accelerated computer graphics have enabled access to large-scale datasets of human body representations. However, while artificial intelligence and machine learning have achieved remarkable success in processing image data, working with 3D shapes in the form of meshes presents unique challenges that often degrade performance in common computer vision and graphics tasks. To overcome these challenges, this project aims to integrate rigorous shape analysis concepts into the design of geometric deep learning models. These models will directly process raw 3D surface scans, independent of acquisition methods, to develop robust algorithmic pipelines for key problems in human body and face analysis. Applications of this work include single-object data representation and reconstruction, body motion generation, facial expression retrieval, and automatic animation. Beyond its implications for augmented and virtual reality, the project will train graduate students and strengthen collaboration between investigators from four institutions in the U.S. and France.    The research focuses on developing efficient deep learning architectures that incorporate fundamental shape invariances into machine-learning pipelines. It consists of three key thrusts: (1) Invariant 3D-to-3D Registration and Reconstruction: This thrust will develop a framework adapted to human body shapes and face scans, combining mathematical shape analysis concepts with advancements in latent space and auto-encoder models in computer graphics; (2) Extension to Time-Dynamic (4D) Data: Building on static 3D data, this thrust will extend methods to dynamic 4D data (3D plus time) for motion analysis and generation. The approach will involve constructing a non-linear structure in the human shape latent space, using a blend of data-driven techniques and physically motivated elastic deformation energies. This will allow accurate modeling of the complex nature of real-life human body motions and deformations; and (3) Prompt-to-Shape Learning: This thrust will focus on mapping prompts, such as text or voice recordings, to shape spaces. Through these efforts, the project seeks to advance the state of geometric deep learning and its applications while fostering international collaboration and academic training.

Subduction zones host the largest earthquakes on Earth, and recent research has revealed more complex deformation events that take place over periods of months or years (referred to here as slow slip and tremor or SST). SST events do not have the sudden destructive power of earthquakes but they can influence the occurrence of large earthquakes. Despite the near ubiquity of SST in modern subduction zones, the mechanisms that drive SST remain poorly understood, in part because direct observations of processes occurring deep in the Earth's crust are not possible. Rocks that have been subducted to SST depths and brought back up to the surface provide a window into processes happening deep in subduction zones. This project will: (1) investigate the types of rocks that potentially hosted SST by analyzing the minerals that make up the rocks, including the ages, chemistry, and deformation and (2) compare the rock record to geophysical imaging of modern subduction zones by modeling the geophysical signature of these rocks based on the observations. Collectively, the results of this work will reveal the distribution of potential SST sources as preserved in the rock record and how they correlate to modern subduction zones. This project involves extensive international collaborations and training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as a postdoctoral scholar. Additionally, as part of this work yearly workshops will be developed in seismic properties, rheology/deformation and geochronology/geochemistry tailored in subduction zone science for the participants of the project. These workshops will result in scientific/methodologic resources and workflows for future research on rock record evidence of SST. These materials will become publicly available as resources for the subduction zone research community.    At the base of the seismogenic zone stored elastic energy may be released gradually in slow slip events along with low frequency earthquakes and non-volcanic tremor that contribute significantly to the seismic cycle. This project addresses long-standing questions on whether slow slip events can be hosted in metasedimentary or meta-mafic rocks and the potential spatial distribution of SST sources. Geophysical studies find that SST often coincides with sheared and underthrusted metasedimentary rocks or with the uppermost oceanic crust of the downgoing slab. However, field observations integrated with experimental constraints suggest that metasedimentary rocks are not good candidates for SST sources. Three subduction complexes were selected that span deep SST depths and offer excellent exposures of underplated metasedimentary rocks intercalated with meta-mafic and meta-ultramafic lithologies. The project will investigate evidence of SST in these complexes (e.g., vein networks, geochemical signatures of alteration) using a field-based approach coupled with geochronology/geochemistry, structural geology, microstructural analysis, and rheology. By using the results from the rock record to calculate seismic properties coupled with the geophysical observations of SST in modern subduction zones, this work will test (a) whether SST may be preferentially accommodated by metasedimentary or meta-mafic lithologies, and (b) how structural heterogeneity along the subduction interface affects the spatial distribution of SST. The outcomes of this work will have implications for the geologic conditions and slip behavior at the base of the seismogenic zone and will therefore better inform both SST observations in active subduction zones and geodynamic models of the seismic cycle and associated earthquake hazards.

    "abstractText": "Stochastic optimization is a fundamental research discipline and a workhorse of learning algorithms. It addresses problems that are stochastic\u2014or random\u2014in nature, such as those arising in the training of machine learning models. The existing theory underlying most learning and optimization algorithms often relies on the simplifying assumption that the data examples observed during training are representative of the data on which the model will be tested or deployed. However, this assumption rarely holds in practice. For example, a facial recognition model trained on broad U.S. data may exhibit varying performance across states with differing demographics, raising concerns about both accuracy and fairness. Similarly, in e-commerce, customer behavior can shift dynamically in response to pricing strategies. This research aims to develop robust algorithms capable of handling these dynamic and uncertain data scenarios. The work will advance optimization techniques to address fundamental supervised learning tasks, yielding algorithms with provable error guarantees that are both computationally and data efficient. These advances will enhance our understanding of learning in dynamic and uncertain data environments, which are central to modern machine learning. Broader impacts include fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations, mentoring students, and organizing a workshop to engage diverse early-career researchers, thereby supporting education, diversity, and innovation in science.     The project will develop new optimization-inspired algorithms to address learning under two models of distributional shifts, forming two main research thrusts. The first thrust focuses on scenarios where the training and testing data distributions differ, studied through the distributionally robust optimization framework. The goal is to train learning models that perform well under worst-case test scenarios within a predefined ambiguity set. By leveraging the structured nature of fundamental tasks in regression and classification, this research aims to address limitations of existing approaches, which often rely on overly general assumptions and produce overly pessimistic results. The second thrust addresses situations where data distributions shift in response to the trained model, such as in performative prediction settings. The key challenge is to achieve stability under these shifts, which translates into solving stochastic fixed-point equations and nonconvex optimization problems. The focus is on advancing algorithmic techniques to tackle structured learning problems, providing guarantees for tasks such as learning single-index models. The proposed research is expected to contribute novel algorithmic techniques in stochastic optimization and learning theory, particularly in areas such as min-max optimization, stochastic fixed-point problems, and learning under label noise.

    "abstractText": "This doctoral dissertation project investigates interregional interaction between prehistoric complex society sites. Archaeological ceramics are well-suited to answer questions about interregional interaction because of the wealth of social and geospatial information they provide through their decoration, form, production, and composition. This project enhances a growing body of literature on ceramic imitation in the archaeological record. The primary data and eventual dissertation generated from this research will be accessible to audiences through open access online publications and databases. Ceramics will be installed in a museum exhibit to further public education. Students participate in laboratory research and gain valuable archaeological experience.     The project evaluates three competing models of long-distance interaction: (a) colonization/migration; (b) emulation; and (c) trade/exchange. Archaeological excavations took place at two Classic period sites which are distant from each other, and which contain similar types of ceramics.  These are sorted into two categories of material culture: (1) low-visibility, which includes rote manufacturing techniques that are not readily apparent to the naked eye and indicate colonization or migration and (2) high-visibility, which includes visible attributes that attract attention and indicate emulation. An analysis of decoration, form, and production technology is conducted to distinguish between low and high-visibility materials. An analysis of ceramic chemical compositions determines whether ceramics were made locally or traded between groups. By testing all three models of interaction, this study will broaden current understandings of interregional relationships of how develop over long periods of time.

    "abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a novel medical device and dental approach for enabling rapid and more effective dental treatments by improving the permeability of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics into teeth. The system aims to augment the delivery of specific compounds for treating tooth decay resulting in over 175 million cavities drilled and filled and $45 billion costs per year in the US, with nearly 15 million requiring root canal therapy resulting in $15 billion costs to remove the underlying infection which topical or systemic antibiotics are unable to effectively treat. In the short term, the system aims to provide an augmentative method for the cosmetic dentistry market by improving teeth whitening treatments currently performed by nearly 80% of Americans, a $7 billion market when combining both the professional and over-the-counter whitening treatment markets.       This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to validate a novel device and approach for controlling electrically-mediated electrokinetic flow for enhancing the delivery of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics into whole human teeth. The novel system is based on experimental results demonstrating electrical voltage, current, time of application, pressure, with an additive for maintaining conductivity improves permeability of specific chemical formulations. These parameters will be validated on the speed and depth of delivery and their effects characterized using several commonly topically applied dental agents including fluoride and hydrogen peroxide bleach. Isolated invitro testing will then be completed to expand the potential for several relevant molecules including antimicrobial and regenerative agents. A prototype device will then be fabricated for enabling first in-human testing at a latter stage. The successful completion of this project therefore aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a novel approach for enabling deeper and more rapid delivery of several clinically relevant molecules into human teeth in an invitro setting, and completion of a prototype device suitable for experimental use.

    "abstractText": "This award supports participation in the 39th Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications (SUMTOPO 2025) taking place August 11-15, 2025 at the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Alabama. Topology is an area of mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century. It has since become a foundational discipline of mathematics, underlying many other areas of mathematics as well as the application of mathematics to the sciences, including logic, computer science, data science, life sciences, game theory, and category theory. As the thirty-ninth event in its series, SUMTOPO 2025 will be an important international event, held in the EPSCoR state of Alabama, that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to low-dimensional topology, dynamics and continuum theory, topological graph theory, set-theoretic topology, and interactions with computing. Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, and graduate students, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants from populations underrepresented in STEM.    SUMPTOPO 2025's session on Low-Dimensional Topology will feature talks related to knot theory and low-dimensional topology, which have seen recent invigoration through the interaction of different techniques from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory, where breakthroughs have often resulted from exchanging tools between fields to resolve outstanding problems. A session on Topological Dynamics and Continuum Theory will feature the study of continua (a topological space that is connected, compact and Hausdorff, and often metric as well) and the continuous mappings between them, as well as dynamical systems, including the study of iterates of a continuous map from a topological space to itself. In recent years there has been increasing interaction between mathematicians working in continuum theory and dynamical systems; in particular, continua arise naturally in the study of the topology and dynamics of one-dimensional and planar systems. In Topological Graph Theory, participants will explore how graphs can be embedded in the 3-dimensional space and on surfaces. This area features several important topics, including the Hadwiger Conjecture, the Colin de Verdi\u00e8re mu invariant, outerplanarity, planarity, and linkless embeddability. The Set-Theoretic Topology session will focus on the study of techniques from set theory that are used to investigate topics in general topology. Such topics include topological games, homogeneity, hyperspaces, topological algebra, compactifications, and much more. Problems about topological topics or properties often require extra axioms of set theory to answer; advances in set theory, conversely, have applications in general topology. Finally, a special session on Topology and Computing will be featured at SUMTOPO 2025 to showcase and disseminate the growing applications of computing for topology, as well as applications of topology on computing, broadly construed. Any research related to both topology and computing will be welcome, including but not limited to, topological data analysis, formalization of topology, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning on topology, and more.

    "abstractText": "The broader impact of this I-Corps project is the development of robust and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) tools for detecting deepfakes. Deep Fakes or AI-generated images, audio, and videos mimicking real people have emerged across various sectors, posing significant threats. The deepfake AI market is expected to undergo significant growth, rising from a value of $564 million in 2024 to an impressive $5,134 million by 2030. This technology is designed to meet the needs of industries highly vulnerable to deepfake threats. Journalists and news organizations require reliable tools to verify content authenticity, preserving credibility and public trust. In media and entertainment sectors, this technology protects intellectual property and ensures content integrity. The finance sector benefits from enhanced fraud detection, while cybersecurity firms can use the developed tools to strengthen defenses against sophisticated cyber-attacks. By providing robust and explainable AI tools, this project enhances detection accuracy, builds public trust, and holds significant commercial potential.    This I-Corps project utilizes experiential learning coupled with a first-hand investigation of the industry ecosystem to assess the translation potential of the technology. This solution is based on the development of generalizable deepfake detectors by focusing on extracting common forgery features from various deepfakes. These features will be used to train a highly accurate deepfake detector, enhanced with robust approaches to improve detector reliability. This robust detector will be integrated with physical and physiological-based explainable methods to provide clear explanations for detection results. To achieve this, a comprehensive library of high-quality, reusable physical/physiological-based models is built. The library makes these methods easily accessible with readable, usable, and maintainable code. To simplify the end user's understanding of detection results, large language models are integrated into the system to provide concise textual explanations and reports.

    "abstractText": "This doctoral dissertation project examines how young children learning two languages acquire new words and connect them to their existing vocabulary. While bilingual children often know fewer words in each language compared to monolingual children, their combined knowledge across languages can match or surpass that of monolingual peers. This project tests whether the way words are organized in the brain helps bilingual children learn new words, focusing on organization due to shared meanings or related concepts. By studying bilingual toddlers, this research informs how children link their knowledge across languages, providing insights into early language development. The findings may advance strategies for teaching vocabulary to bilingual children, helping parents, educators, and caregivers support language learning in ways that build on children\u2019s existing strengths. This project involves bilingual toddlers from diverse communities. Other benefits to society include providing educational and workforce development opportunities for undergraduate research assistants.    This project examines how the connections between words in one language influence learning in the other language. For example, a child who knows many words about animals in one language may find it easier to learn new animal-related words in the other language. This research examines two types of words, completely new words (that require learning both a concept and a label) and translation equivalents (words for the same concept in both languages). Testing is conducted virtually, which increases access for families who might not otherwise participate in research studies. This work (1) advances a scientific understanding of how bilingual children leverage cross-language semantic density to learn new words and translation equivalents, (2) contributes new knowledge to theories and models of bilingual word learning, accounting for cross-language semantic density, and (3) informs models of bilingual instruction, potentially extending their application to an earlier developmental age.

While there are four times as many engineering master\u2019s recipients as PhDs in the United States most prior research on engineering graduate students has focused on doctoral students.  As a consequence, we know almost nothing about the experiences, motivations, career planning, and skills required by industry of master\u2019s degree students. This project will focus on this critical segment of the workforce with an initial focus on mechanical engineering.  The work will help us to systematically understand how to better prepare master\u2019s students for their jobs so that they can make contributions in their careers from the outset.   To help inform graduate curricular offerings, we will use cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence techniques to illuminate the specific skills employers want from employees who have engineering master\u2019s degrees. Our research will help identify potential strategies for recruiting more students to engineering master\u2019s programs, in particular domestic students, which is a critical need for the future workforce. The findings of this project will better inform students, employers, administrators, and those considering master\u2019s degrees about the skills desired and expected of mechanical engineering master\u2019s recipients.    This project will advance novel applications of natural language processing (NLP) coupled with interview research to understand the skills and benefits of terminal engineering master\u2019s degrees. The quantitative element of the project will involve analysis of over a decade of engineering job postings.  We will develop and apply an algorithm to extract skills from this substantial set of data to advance our understanding of the engineering workforce and make methodological advances in NLP. The qualitative element will involve collection and analysis of interviews with current master\u2019s students about their reasons for pursuing a master\u2019s degree, including desired skills.  The project will mix these qualitative and quantitative analyses to identify mis(alignments) between what is communicated from the workforce about desired skills via job advertisements and current perceptions of the workforce from current master\u2019s students. This research will fill an important gap in research on master\u2019s-level engineering students, building knowledge about motivations for pursuing a master\u2019s degree and employer expectations, including the most marketable skills.

    "abstractText": "This CAREER award focuses on designing mechanisms that allocate resources in a way that maximizes \"consumer utility,\" defined as the value of the allocation received minus the payments made. This is particularly important in social services, or generally when charging monetary payments is infeasible. In such cases, to ration demand or prove user need, a non-monetary cost is imposed on consumers, such as waiting in line or filling out labor-intensive paperwork. The project explores trade-offs between efficient allocation and the burdens imposed on individuals, aiming to develop simple, explainable mechanisms guiding principles on when to use these mechanisms in practice. Through this project, the investigator will also (1) build research communities locally with workshops and online via reading groups, (2) broaden participation in computing through mentoring, awareness, and recruitment, and (3) develop educational materials based on this project's research.    This project will pioneer the field of  multidimensional algorithmic utility maximization when ordeals are payments.  With an objective of expected (Bayesian) social welfare minus revenue, this optimization problem introduces tension between efficiently allocating and using payments to do so. Allocating multiple items only complicates the problem, as reducing an item's allocation can sometimes yield more utility than charging payments. The investigation is organized into three thrusts: (1) characterize utility-optimal mechanisms, proving their intractability and solving for optimal mechanisms at the frontier of tractability, (2) approximate optimal utility by upper-bounding the quantity and designing simple, practical mechanisms with provable guarantees, and (3) apply the theory of utility maximization and ordeals to practical domain-specific questions.

    "abstractText": "Graphs, which can be thought of as a collection of nodes, called vertices, and connections between certain of these nodes, called edges, play an important role in the theory of networks, communication, scheduling, and optimization. Edge coloring and edge packing can be considered partitions of the edges of a graph under certain restrictions. For example, a proper edge coloring partitions the edges into sets such that no two edges in the same set share a common endpoint, while an edge cover packing partitions the edges into sets such that the edges in each set cover all the vertices. Optimal or near-optimal solutions to these problems are important for the above mentioned applications. The PI plans to explore both the theory of edge coloring and packing, as well as to develop corresponding efficient algorithms. Graduate students will be involved in this project.    Several open problems in this field are related to the graph parameter called density. Density measures the 'densest' part of a graph, which is often the main concern when solving edge coloring and packing problems. With density-related techniques such as the generalized Tashkinov tree, developed from solving the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture, and the generalized Kempe change method, developed from solving the Core conjecture of Hilton and Zhao, the PI proposes to work on (1) the Berge-Fulkerson conjecture, (2) Gupta\u2019s co-density conjecture, (3) Goldberg\u2019s generalization of the total coloring conjecture for multigraphs, (4) the Overfull conjecture, and (5) finding efficient algorithms to color graphs with the optimal number of colors as stated in the aforementioned conjectures.

    "abstractText": "Clustering is the task of grouping objects so that those in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It is widely used in unsupervised learning, data analysis, information retrieval, and community detection. This project contributes to the theory of clustering by aiming to understand the extent to which clustering can be efficiently approximated by leveraging tools and ideas from metric embedding, coding theory, extremal combinatorics, and analysis of Boolean functions. Seeking the optimal inapproximability of clustering not only sheds light on problems important to the theoretical computer science community but also enriches other fields such as machine learning, data science, and computer vision, equipping future researchers in all these fields to tackle other geometric optimization problems effectively. The educational activities of this project include integrating findings into graduate and undergraduate courses, mentoring students, and broadening participation in theoretical computer science.     In technical terms, the primary goal of this project is to establish tight NP-hardness of approximation results for key clustering problems, such as minimizing k-means, k-median, and k-center objectives in L_p (i.e., L subscript p) metrics. A secondary goal is to study these objectives through the lenses of fine-grained complexity and the theory of stable instances. The three main research directions are: (i) resolving the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis, (ii) determining tight hardness of approximation factors for popular clustering objectives in the Euclidean metric, and (iii) proving conditional lower bounds for the Euclidean k-means problem with fixed k.

    "abstractText": "The evolution of database architectures has prioritized speed, capacity, scalability, and flexibility over privacy considerations, creating challenges in protecting sensitive data like healthcare, biometrics, financial, and educational records. Privacy policies and regulations often fail to integrate seamlessly with data-management practices, complicating the task of ensuring privacy across end-to-end workflows. In addition, decoupling decentralized data management and decentralized machine learning (ML) over federated data silos (i.e., federated learning) causes difficulties in detecting malicious clients and handling diverse data distributions. This project aims to address these shortcomings by developing a database architecture to integrate the privacy regulation and compliance process, enhance federated learning with decentralized data-management functions such as data synthesis and profiling, and automate privacy-model configuration in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows. The project will be evaluated using real-world healthcare and biometrics workloads to demonstrate policy consistency, better privacy-utility tradeoffs, and improvement of productivity in configuring privacy-preserving mechanisms. This project will leverage the partnership between Texas A&M University - Central Texas and Arizona State University to train underrepresented students in both universities at the intersection of AI/ML, privacy, and database systems.     The project aims to provide a data-architecture design that enables unified privacy policies, enhance federated learning with advanced data management, and optimize privacy-aware query and storage mechanisms. This project consists of the following research thrusts: (i) developing a database system that integrates AI/ML capabilities, facilitating the coordination of data-privacy policies, AI/ML workflows, and regulatory compliance as well as ensuring that data management and privacy regulations are seamlessly aligned with AI/ML processes; (ii) building a federated data-management framework for federated learning to enhance incentive mechanisms, detect malicious gradients, and balance non-independent and identical distribution to improve the accuracy and robustness of federated learning; and (iii) creating query and storage optimizers that automatically select the appropriate model architecture for privacy-preserving training requests, as well as the storage scheme for the resulting model, thereby ensuring that user utility and privacy objectives are met and enhancing both the effectiveness and the privacy of end-to-end AI/ML workflows.

    "abstractText": "A hydrothermal explosion rocked Black Diamond Pool in Biscuit Basin, Yellowstone National Park (YNP) on July 23, 2024, spewing rock and debris tens of meters into the air, damaging the boardwalk, and sending visitors scrambling away. The area has since been closed to the public. Another smaller explosion occurred on November 5 causing the spring to erupt ~ seven meters high. This project will collect samples to establish the geochemical and microbial changes in Black Diamond and surrounding springs in response to the hydrothermal explosions in order to detail the response to a steam explosion perturbation, a fundamental knowledge gap. In addition, this project will document the return to baseline normalcy for the area, advise the Biscuit Basin Emergency Response Team on their goal of safely opening the area to the public again, and perhaps lend insight into beginning to be able to help anticipate these hydrothermal explosion events in the future.    Seven to eight full aqueous geochemical and planktonic and corresponding sediment microbiological samples will be collected once a month for ten months (70-80 total) from Black Diamond Pool and nearby Biscuit Basin springs and geysers with corresponding aqueous geochemical parameters measured in the field with meters and field spectrophotometry. Data will give insight into the impact of two hydrothermal explosions at Black Diamond Pool in YNP on the aqueous geochemistry, input of major and micronutrients, and microbial diversity of the hydrothermal system. Present knowledge of microbial responses to geologic events is limited and this hydrothermal explosion system provides a unique opportunity to detail the geochemical and microbial response especially since more explosions are unexpectedly occurring in the same location. In addition, sparse geochemical data exist for Biscuit Geyser Basin and this project will expand our knowledge of the geochemistry and microbiology in this unique geyser basin.

    "abstractText": "The project aims to address critical gaps in our understanding of what noisy quantum devices can achieve, especially in the near and medium term. The investigators plans to explore three key areas: 1) developing new methods to demonstrate quantum advantage in noisy environments, particularly by making Shor's famous factoring algorithm feasible on current quantum devices; 2) proving the limitations of quantum devices that rely on geometrically local interactions, highlighting the need for long-range connectivity in experiments; and 3) creating benchmarks using machine learning theory to verify whether these devices are correctly implementing their intended tasks. By focusing on these areas, the research will develop new protocols and provide theoretical insights that are crucial for advancing quantum computing, even at current noise levels. The project will leverage ideas from quantum computing and machine learning, and closely collaborate with experimentalists to ensure their findings are both rigorous and practically applicable. The project will also develop new courses to bring together graduate and undergraduate students from different departments to grapple with present-day challenges in quantum computing.    The proposal will focus on three critical areas to deepen our theoretical understanding of noisy quantum devices, i.e., Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ). First, the researchers will develop a novel fault-tolerance theorem that maintains constant-depth overhead, enabling Shor's algorithm on NISQ devices. Second, they will aim to establish no-go theorems for geometrically local noisy quantum systems, providing rigorous proof that long-range interactions are essential for achieving quantum advantage in these systems. Finally, they will leverage learning theory to construct algorithms that can rigorously determine whether a noisy quantum device accurately executes the programmed quantum circuit or adiabatic process. This research will fill theoretical gaps in the understanding of NISQ devices, introducing new protocols that offer low-overhead fault tolerance, and provide formal proofs of the necessity of non-local interactions in quantum computation. Interdisciplinary techniques are expected to play a crucial role in the proposal. Collaboration with experimental groups will ensure the relevance and applicability of the theoretical models of noisy devices.

    "abstractText": "The rapid growth of smart, connected computing devices in critical fields like transportation, industrial automation, healthcare, and finance has made our society increasingly dependent on their safe, secure, and reliable operation. System-on-Chip (SoC) designs are the hardware backbone of these systems. An SoC design integrates a large number of pre-designed components that coordinate through sophisticated system-level protocols to realize various system functions. The components may contain vulnerabilities due to malicious modification or design mistakes, which can be exploited to leak secrets or cause system malfunction. Therefore, SoC designs must undergo comprehensive and rigorous validation to ensure safety and security before deployment in critical applications. Although large bodies of verification and validation methods have been developed, the existing methods are too slow to thoroughly verify large complex SoC designs before their silicon fabrication (the \"pre-silicon\" stage) while the existing solutions are not useful for validating fabricated chips (the \"post-silicon\" stage) since not all internal signals can be observed or analyzed. These challenges prevent achieving the high level of confidence needed for SoCs in critical applications. This project aims to develop a holistic framework that integrates novel solutions to overcome the limitations of the existing pre-silicon verification and post-silicon validation methods, enabling efficient and comprehensive SoC validation across the entire design flow. The resulting impacts of this research include substantially improved productivity and quality of SoC validation, ultimately providing greater assurance in deployed SoC designs, technology transfer through close collaboration with industry on real-world designs with practical significance, and workforce development through recruitment and training of students from diverse backgrounds.    Prior studies have shown that intricate communications among the components in a SoC design are a major source of errors.  This project focuses on representing and analyzing cross-block communications to reduce validation complexity. Models characterizing such communications serve as a unifying thread to tie validation activities across both pre-silicon and post-silicon stages. The project consists of three tasks. Task 1 develops solutions to facilitate efficient and comprehensive pre-silicon full system validation based on a communication-centric methodology. Task 2 develops approaches to learning system communication models from the SoC execution traces generated during the full system validation to facilitate analysis and debug.  Task 3 develops new machine learning methods utilizing the communication models from Task 2 to enhance the observability of the post-silicon traces for more efficient post-silicon debug. Throughout this project, the power of recent deep sequence modeling approaches, such as the transformer model and its variants, as well as sequential pattern mining methods are exploited in novel ways to achieve the technical aims of this project.

    "abstractText": "This project serves the national interest by working to broaden participation of students from a breadth of populations in the mathematical sciences. Specifically, this project will organize the 2025 Annual Gulf States Math Alliance (GSMATH) Conference and offer a faculty development workshop to support the use of collaborative mentoring strategies by mathematics faculty at participating institutions. The GSMATH Conference will be held at Southern University New Orleans from February 14 - 16, 2025. The conference is organized by GSMATH, which is the regional mathematics alliance covering the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. GSMATH includes an active and strong network of faculty mentors in over 25 HSIs (Hispanic Serving Institutions), HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), and other institutions that serve a breadth of student populations. Building from prior GSMATH conferences, it is anticipated that over 100 students and 50 faculty will attend the conference. Student sessions will center on demystifying pathways through undergraduate degree programs in the mathematical sciences. Keynote speakers, panel discussions, a student poster session, and a graduate school fair will provide multiple opportunities for students to network, ask questions, and receive mentoring. The faculty workshop will focus on supporting students as they transition from 2-year and 4-year colleges into graduate education or the workforce.    The GSMATH conference will directly contribute to efforts to broaden participation and support students' knowledge of educational and career pathways in the mathematical sciences. This, in turn, has potential to improve STEM education and academic outcomes for students across disciplines. Panels such as \"What I wish I knew Before Graduate School,\" \"Non-Academic Math Careers,\" and an undergraduate-graduate student dialogue, will enable participating students to get advice from faculty and experienced peers. The involvement of community college (CC) mathematics faculty and students is a critical element of the GSMATH conference, as 2-year colleges are a starting point for many students pursuing bachelor\u2019s and graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences. The faculty development workshop will not only present an opportunity for faculty to collaboratively mentor those students throughout the year but will also address critical transition points from CCs to four-year institutions and from undergraduate to graduate studies. Faculty development will also strengthen connections among participating institutions, supporting the growth of a responsive community of mentors across the discipline. This project is funded by the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and increase capacity to engage in the development and implementation of innovations to improve STEM teaching and learning at HSIs.

    "abstractText": "This project aims to serve the national interest to improve undergraduate STEM education by examining the status and trajectory of Discipline-Based Education Research.  In 2012, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine issued a report entitled Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER): Understanding and Improving Learning in Undergraduate Science and Engineering that outlined the promise of DBER in improving STEM education and made recommendations for advancing the field.  The proposed project is intended as a follow-up to the 2012 study, to examine the current state of affairs in DBER.  Significant progress has been made in recognizing and developing DBER as a field of study, with DBER scholars embedded in a variety of departments and translation of DBER findings into undergraduate STEM teaching practices.  The proposed project intends to systematically examine the work accomplished since the release of the initial report, with the intention of articulating progress, identifying gaps in research and application of knowledge, and illuminating points of convergence and divergence between different disciplines engaged in DBER.    The National Academies will convene a planning committee composed of approximately seven members with a broad understanding of the issues related to DBER, including professional learning, higher education administration, research administration, and institutional change.  Through a series of meetings, the planning committee will create a list of potential topics to be covered in a larger workshop, as well as identify potential speakers, panelists, and discussants.  A public workshop will be held in Washington DC, with potential attendees spanning a range of disciplines, institution types, career stages, and expertise.  To increase accessibility, the workshop will be live-streamed, enabling virtual participation by individuals unable to attend in person.  Workshop proceeding will be gathered, edited, and posted to the National Academies website and a public webinar will be held to discuss the main points identified in the workshop.

    "abstractText": "Lakes can undergo rapid and sustained changes in water quality. These changes, often referred to as regime shifts, can substantially alter the lake environment, including food webs. Regime shifts often occur when conditions cross tipping points, but understanding the feedbacks and attributes that lead to regime shifts can be challenging. Increases in dissolved organic matter in lake water, termed lake browning, are occurring in many regions. Dissolved organic matter regulates water clarity, water temperature, ecosystem respiration, and many other lake attributes, suggesting potentially long-term and substantial impacts. Lake browning may stimulate lake dissolved oxygen losses, termed deoxygenation, that leads to further increases in dissolved organic matter and nutrients, ultimately resulting in sustained water quality impairment. This project seeks to understand the impacts of an anticipated lake regime shift driven by increases in dissolved organic matter and its impact on the lake overall. There may be tipping points associated with the low dissolved oxygen in lake bottom waters, driven by the increases in dissolved organic matter. Broader impacts include undergraduate student research experiences and community outreach activities.     Using a sophisticated suite of sensors, manually-collected long-term data spanning multiple decades, experiments, and ecosystem models will help discern the consequences of lake browning and low dissolved oxygen availability in lakes. Studying multiple lakes that vary in dissolved organic matter, nutrients, and oxygen availability will provide the capacity to compare and assess feedbacks and tipping points resulting from rapid increases in dissolved organic matter that may push water quality conditions toward several potential future trajectories. This research will provide a foundation to understand the implications of widespread aquatic deoxygenation through research and data publications and training of early career scientists in the use of sophisticated sensors and other technologies. This project will extend a long-term data set of water quality variables sampled since the late 1980s of Lakes Lacawac and Giles in or near the Lacawac Sanctuary and Biological Field Station, located in northeastern Pennsylvania.

    "abstractText": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of chemicals that can contaminate the environment and affect public health. Because of the health concerns, there is a critical need to understand how humans are exposed to PFAS compounds transported through the environment. On August 19, 2024, there was a spill of PFAS-containing firefighting foam at the Brunswick Executive Airport in Brunswick, Maine. Investigators will measure PFAS concentrations in soil and water samples obtained from multiple sites around the spill over the course of one year. These measurements will be used to assess how these PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d move through soil and water over time. Benefits to society from this project include data sharing with scientists and educators to advance knowledge, and results disseminated in the form of peer reviewed studies that regulators, policymakers, and other stakeholders can use to implement better strategies for emergency response to such spills.    Research has demonstrated that PFAS contamination of the environment has significant effects on human and ecological health. Researchers typically have access only to studies of sites that have been contaminated in the past such as landfills, burn pits, or former manufacturing facilities. This results in a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of PFAS fate and transport from recent releases. A spill of firefighting foam containing high concentrations of PFAS at the Brunswick Executive Airport presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reveal mechanistic insights about PFAS contamination after a spill in a well-defined watershed. The goal of this project is to understand the distribution of PFAS within the soil horizon and the impacted watershed as a function of time and proximity to the spill site. The specific research objectives are to collect, archive, and analyze PFAS in soil and water samples at various locations over time to reveal mechanistic insight on PFAS fate and transport. Results from this study can help develop mitigation strategies for emergency response groups to prioritize containment and clean up. In addition, the work can help impacted municipalities implement effective water advisories for their residents, as well as benefiting a broader group of researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders who study and manage PFAS contamination.

    "abstractText": "The use of light-activated gold nanoparticles for thermal ablation of cancerous tissue and localized thermally-activated drug and gene delivery systems has been extensively investigated. However, these therapeutic approaches have stalled at the preclinical stage because the nanoparticle temperature cannot be controlled precisely, which leads to effects on tissue away from the therapeutic target. The conversion of light to heat inside the nanoparticles is efficient and fast, which means the key parameter determining overall therapeutic efficiency is the thermal energy dissipation across the interface between the gold nanoparticles and the surrounding medium, i.e., biological fluid. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to broaden our understanding of heat transfer across solid-liquid interfaces, which is a highly complex problem that involves surface chemistry, interfacial liquid properties, and energy carrier physics. The broader activities of this project will include the creation of a podcast for societal outreach, and several educational activities, including a course on the research tools used by the investigators.      The goal of this project is to engineer a methodology for the spatiotemporal temperature control of solvated gold nanoparticles by focusing on the interfacial dissipation of thermal energy. The research plan is driven by the hypothesis that interfacial liquid properties and structuring determine the solid-liquid interfacial thermal conductance, which is the missing link between existing theory and experiments. This project will address this knowledge gap through a combination of unique experimental and computational efforts including: (i) spectroscopy techniques for probing the interfacial liquid properties; (ii) interface-sensitive laser pump-probe metrology for accurate thermal boundary conductance measurements; (iii) reactive force field development for capturing thermally-sensitive chemistry; and (iv) multiscale (atomistic and continuum) modeling of heat transfer in solvated nanoparticle systems.

Examples include ecological dynamics in a varied environment and fluctuating flame fronts in combustion. Nonetheless, such systems often exhibit tractable behavior when viewed at large or fine scales. This \"asymptotic\" behavior plays a major role in applications, and often has a universal character that unites the study of disparate systems. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) will combine several mathematical methods to identify and justify asymptotic phenomena in partial differential equations (PDEs) originating in the sciences. This work has the potential to shed light on a variety of systems including ecological invasion, atomic deposition, and fluid shock formation. The PI is committed to undergraduate and graduate mentorship, with the particular aim of supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds.     This project will explore the asymptotic behavior of various deterministic and stochastic PDEs in significant limiting regimes. The project comprises three interconnected lines of work.

This investigation encompasses a dual analysis of associated branching particle systems. (2) The PI will combine analytic and probabilistic methods to study long-time and white-noise limits of several physically motivated stochastic PDEs, including stochastic conservation laws and stochastic heat equations near criticality.

    "abstractText": "Everyday activities and behaviors depend on the building of complex brain circuits during development. Critical steps in the maturation of these circuits include neurons extending axons to their correct target, and the formation of synapses, sites of communication between neurons. A family of proteins, membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), has well-known roles in neuron growth, target selection and synapse formation. However, the biochemical mechanisms that regulate these proteins action in specific circuits of the developing brain remain unknown. This investigation will determine the impact of dysregulating the function of RTKs in the development of brain circuits that control social and emotional behaviors. The proposed studies will contribute greater insight into circuit maturation during development, that is necessary for basic and complex neural function, such as movement, perception and learning. This research project represents a new collaboration between investigators in Switzerland and the USA, aligning with NSF\u2019s mission to foster and support collaborative international research.    Circuit formation includes axon guidance, target selection and collateralization, and dendritic growth that coincide with synapse formation, maturation and pruning. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a diverse family with well-known roles in these processes. There are significant knowledge gaps in understanding the relation between post-translational modifications of different phosphorylation sites and engagement of select intracellular pathways that mediate diverse neurodevelopmental processes. The MET receptor tyrosine kinase mediates the timing of spine and excitatory synapse maturation in the cortex. A new MET phosphorylation site, serine (S)1014 in mice, was recently discovered and characterized. Mice with a genetic substitution that prevents phosphorylation at that site (METS1014A mice) exhibit neuronal adaptations in the forebrain distinct from those observed following genetic deletion of Met. Studies in the U.S. will determine the profile of S1014 phosphorylation and identify changes in downstream intracellular signaling across cortical development in METS1014A mice. In vitro and in vivo studies will measure the impact of signaling alterations on dendritic growth and synaptogenesis, glutamate synapse maturation and inhibitory neuron development.

    "abstractText": "The objective of this project is to support investigation into how sea-level rise and coastal flooding impact the ability of local communities to plan for and adapt to extreme coastal events, such as flooding. Many local governments in coastal regions are grappling with financial challenges on budgets and infrastructure investment. This project addresses the gap between fiscal stress caused by extreme coastal flooding events and financial need for adaptation. The findings aim to inform local and regional policymakers and planners responsible for economic planning and land use decisions.     Municipalities struggle with limited resources and are unable to effectively manage financial risk and consequence of extreme costal events, such as flooding. This project improves the understanding of how property devaluation due to flooding affects municipal tax revenues, which in turn constrains governments' capacity to invest in adaptation measures. Built upon advanced flood risk models and projections of inundation and accessibility disruption, this project reveals the spatial and temporal patterns of flooding impact on tax base and infrastructure. Furthermore, it explores how these financial challenges influence local adaptation efforts through in-depth engagement with local planners and officials. The findings are expected to offer new insights into how municipalities can adapt their land use and planning policies to cope with rising risks and co-produce integrated solutions to enhance flooding resilience and fiscal stability.

The hybrid workshop will gather researchers and students to address indoor air quality issues resulting from wildland fire emissions. The research will have a particular focus on the Southeast U.S., which experiences more wildland fires than any other region of the U.S. The workshop will feature keynote speeches and panel discussions by national experts, as well as tutorials, hands-on instrument demonstrations, and student competitions to facilitate knowledge transfer and develop communication skills. Results will be disseminated through a publication summarizing the current state of knowledge and potential solutions. Society will benefit from this workshop through the advancement of knowledge on wildland fire emissions. Such information can be used to develop new systems to address indoor air pollution and associated human health impacts caused by these fires.      The University of Miami Center for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST) workshop focuses on advanced indoor air quality control and impacts of wildland fire emissions in the Southeast U.S. Wildland fires are a growing global concern, particularly in the Southeast U.S., which experiences the largest number of wildland fires, comparable to the rest of the U.S. combined. Significant gaps in our understanding exist on how pollutants from wildland fires impact both climate and the infiltration of air pollutants to indoor environments. Such infiltration exacerbates human health risks due to poor ventilation and filtration. To address these challenges, the CAST workshop will present new research findings on Southeast U.S. biomass burning emissions, advanced air quality sensor design, risk assessment methods, and building controls to mitigate health risks associated with indoor air pollution. Hands-on instrumentation and tutorial sessions will demonstrate state-of-the-art technology for monitoring and controlling air pollutants, equipping attendees with the skills needed to tackle these research problems. The involvement of non-profit organizations, such as Healthy Little Havana, will enhance community engagement on these issues. Additionally, student participation will foster career development and contribute to a skilled future STEM workforce. Results will be disseminated through a published manuscript that summarizes our current understanding and potential solutions to issues associated with wildland fire emissions and indoor air quality control.

Because of the health concerns, there is a critical need to understand how humans are exposed to PFAS compounds transported through the environment. On August 19, 2024, there was a spill of PFAS-containing firefighting foam at the Brunswick Executive Airport in Brunswick, Maine. Investigators will measure PFAS concentrations in soil and water samples obtained from multiple sites around the spill over the course of one year. These measurements will be used to assess how these PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d move through soil and water over time. Benefits to society from this project include data sharing with scientists and educators to advance knowledge, and results disseminated in the form of peer reviewed studies that regulators, policymakers, and other stakeholders can use to implement better strategies for emergency response to such spills.    Research has demonstrated that PFAS contamination of the environment has significant effects on human and ecological health. Researchers typically have access only to studies of sites that have been contaminated in the past such as landfills, burn pits, or former manufacturing facilities. This results in a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of PFAS fate and transport from recent releases. A spill of firefighting foam containing high concentrations of PFAS at the Brunswick Executive Airport presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reveal mechanistic insights about PFAS contamination after a spill in a well-defined watershed. The goal of this project is to understand the distribution of PFAS within the soil horizon and the impacted watershed as a function of time and proximity to the spill site. The specific research objectives are to collect, archive, and analyze PFAS in soil and water samples at various locations over time to reveal mechanistic insight on PFAS fate and transport. Results from this study can help develop mitigation strategies for emergency response groups to prioritize containment and clean up. In addition, the work can help impacted municipalities implement effective water advisories for their residents, as well as benefiting a broader group of researchers, policymakers and other stakeholders who study and manage PFAS contamination.

    "abstractText": "This project focuses on making industrial processes more sustainable and efficient, particularly for creating propylene, a key chemical used in many commercial products. Producing propylene is challenging because current methods waste carbon and require significant energy, which is not sustainable. This research explores a novel way to improve the process by studying how induction heating, which is a method of generating heat using magnetic fields, can enhance the process reaction and make the process more efficient. This will result in a reduced carbon footprint and additional investments in renewable energy technologies. The project also includes educational outreach to inspire students to learn about sustainability and decarbonization, helping build a greener future.     The goal of the CAREER project is to understand the influence of induction heating on the bonding and activity of industrially relevant catalysts via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene. The objectives of the project are: (1) to determine the effects of localized heating on PDH activity; (2) to elucidate the surface reconstruction of platinum atoms under induction heating; and (3) to establish the impact of the magnetic field on the spin states of electrons on the bonding. This investigation will isolate thermal and magnetic effects to clarify the reaction mechanism and kinetics, as well as ascertain the local coordination environment of platinum and cobalt in the presence of magnetic fields. The CAREER project will validate the impact of the electromagnetic field on the spin state during PDH, which can minimize further hydrogenation and enhance the selectivity of propylene. Such efforts will serve as a foundational pillar toward the investigator\u2019s long-term career objective of comprehensively understanding the dynamic environment of active sites, facilitating precise analyses of reaction pathways and kinetics, in addition to the development of sustainable catalytic processes aimed at decarbonizing the chemical industry.

    "abstractText": "The understanding and accurate prediction of tropical cyclone formation (\u201cgenesis\u201d) remains challenging. Sometimes, genesis from weak tropical waves in the western Atlantic and Caribbean occurs unexpectedly. These low-confidence forecasts give limited time for officials and the public to prepare for a potential hurricane impact. The project is aimed at advancing knowledge of these issues using conventional and AI techniques, ensemble forecasts, and state-of-the-art modeling.  The project will offer insights and suggestions to forecasters and model developers on the strengths and weaknesses of conventional and AI-based models. Another expected outcome is the identification of time windows of increased and decreased predictive confidence, and thereby a basis for enhanced, actionable forecasts. The project will support the education of graduate and undergraduate students, and the introduction of AI and ensemble techniques in the classroom.  Students will engage with professionals, advance outreach to increase public scientific literacy, and participate in mentoring programs. Results and software will be shared with the community.    The research will use reanalysis data, ensemble forecasts, and multiscale modeling to investigate the processes and predictability in the 5 days leading up to genesis and immediately after. The mechanisms of weak waves that had a low genesis probability but developed into tropical cyclones will be compared against higher-probability developers and non-developers. While the fate of precursor disturbances is understood to depend on the environmental preconditioning and organization of convection, the specific nature of these processes remains open to question for the low-probability situations. A key hypothesis is that intense convective bursts occur on small scales and couple quickly with the wave, leading to upscale growth, rapid axisymmetrization, and genesis. The sensitivity of genesis to the timing and location of convection is expected to be high, suggesting a short range of predictability. In higher-probability developers, this sensitivity is expected to be lower. It is expected that there will be case-by-case variability which depends on the strength and symmetry of the precursor. The research will also include a novel AI-based wave tracker that surpasses the capability of conventional trackers in the western Atlantic and Caribbean, and investigations using the world\u2019s first operational global ensemble that is driven by AI.

    "abstractText": "Many of our manufactured chemical products and fuels derive from fossil-based resources such as natural gas and petroleum, which also serve as our primary source of energy via combustion, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Natural gas and petroleum consist of molecules with varying amounts of carbon and hydrogen.  While this is convenient for chemical manufacturing of hydrocarbon products such as plastics, fibers, and construction materials, it does not fit well with green chemical processing where the products must be built from renewable carbon materials (such as biosources) and hydrogen produced from the splitting of water molecules via renewable energy sources such as solar or wind. While fossil sources come with the carbon and hydrogen already molecularly linked, production of chemicals from biosources or captured carbon often requires transport of hydrogen from small-scale, highly distributed sources.  Because of the inherent challenges in transporting gaseous hydrogen, this has created a need for so-called liquid carrier molecules that are rich in hydrogen and can be readily shuttled to distributed chemical plants where the carrier molecules can be decomposed on-demand to generate hydrogen to react with carbon resources.  Ammonia (NH3) is one such carrier molecule.  The focus of the project is on efficient catalytic decomposition of NH3 to support low-carbon chemicals and fuels production. To that end, a key thrust of the project is to explore the use of magnetic induction heating (MIH) to provide the energy needed for hydrogen release.  MIH can be driven by sustainably produced electricity, thus offering a carbon-free alternative to fossil-fuel process energy.       The overarching project goal is to understand how operating magnetic induction heater in a dynamic magnetic field (DMF) mode, with varied field strength H and switching frequency f, enables the modulated spin polarization of the catalytic atoms in representative Fe-based ferromagnetic catalysts, thereby achieving overall high reactivity in NH3 decomposition and stability against nitridation. NH3 decomposition kinetics wrestle with the well-known Sabatier limit, which centers around the binding strengths of the *N-based species.  Among the elementary reaction steps, the first *N-H bond scission (to produce H2) and the associative desorption of the dehydrogenated *N (to produce N2) are characterized by competing energetics.  In a \u201cstatic\u201d thermal reaction where a catalytic metal has a single spin state, favoring one of the above two steps will inevitably disfavor the other.  The study is built on the hypothesis that by leveraging the DMF in the MIH reaction mode, two-state catalytic centers featuring low and high polarized states can be created periodically at high frequencies, thereby becoming kinetically favorable for both *N-H scission (for strong N-atom catalyst binding) and associative *N desorption (for weak N-atom catalyst binding), thus inducing a \u201cdynamic\u201d chemically-enhanced thermal reaction. The research will begin with developing Fe/MgO catalyst platforms for comparative studies in thermal and MIH reaction modes. The findings from the Fe/MgO system will build toward exploring M-Ox-Fe variants (M= Co, Ru, Pd) to probe distinctive outermost d-orbital structures for modulating the spin polarization.  The experimental investigations will center around how the catalysts respond to the dynamic magnetic field from kinetics, binding behaviors, and catalytic atom properties - benchmarking to standard thermal reactions.   Lab-based kinetic studies will be extended to embrace catalyst synthesis variations (e.g., particle size), MIH studies under static and dynamic conditions, and computational studies conducted by  collaborators at Clemson University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, and Tulane University. Through integrated research and educational initiatives, the project entails a suite of \u201cFail Forward\u201d student training components in the context of electric field enhanced reactions, which build upon standard thermal reaction knowledge and serve as a gateway to encourage students to step outside their knowledge comfort zones to embrace ever-evolving science, and thus develop autonomy for lifelong learning. The project will reach 500+ students annually from grades 6 to the graduate level to accelerate the development of the future engineering workforce in South Carolina and beyond.

    "abstractText": "This CAREER project aims to develop a new method to better understand how cells are organized in tissues and how cells interact with each other over time. Recent advances in a technology called spatial transcriptomics have allowed scientists to study gene activity in tissue samples and see how cells are distributed within their environment. However, this technology currently provides only a snapshot of what is happening in the cells at a single moment, which limits our understanding of how cells change and respond to different conditions over time. To address this gap, this project will focus on creating a system that can track molecular changes in live tissue over time. This work aims to develop a new technology using a nanostructure (e.g., nanowires) to extract important molecules from live cells with minimal disturbance, allowing for repeated sampling and enabling longitudinal measurements. This will allow for continuous monitoring of cell activity and interactions, which can help scientists learn how cells develop, change, and respond to diseases. By improving the understanding of cellular behavior, this research has the potential to advance medical treatments, particularly for diseases that involve complex interactions between cells. This project also supports education and workforce development by training students in cutting-edge research techniques. The ultimate goal is to use this technology to improve healthcare and contribute to advances in science that benefit society and national well-being.     Recent advancements in spatial transcriptomics have transformed understanding of cellular heterogeneity, enabling the identification of new cellular interactions and functional dynamics between different cell types and their microenvironments that were previously elusive. This technology allows researchers to study gene expression in the context of tissue architecture, providing a more complete understanding of the cellular function and interactions between cells. Although this method preserves the spatial information, it only offers a snapshot of gene expression at a single point in time, providing a static view of the dynamic biological processes. To fully understand the complex and temporal nature of tissue function and disease progression, it is essential to monitor molecular changes over time. Integrating spatial transcriptomics with longitudinal studies will be crucial for unraveling the continuous and evolving nature of cellular behavior. To address this limitation, the overall objective of this CAREER project is to develop a new method for the spatiotemporal monitoring of live tissue gene expression. This work proposes to develop a nanowire-based molecular transfer technology that can extract molecules from live cells and transfer them to a hydrogel to achieve spatiotemporal transcriptomics. By monitoring molecular changes within specific regions of tissue over time, researchers can gain valuable insights into how different cell types interact and respond to changes in the tissue microenvironment.

    "abstractText": "As the amount of data being generated is rapidly increasing and many technologies keep scaling up, more and more applications are relying on cloud servers for high-performance computing and data processing. The scalability offered by cloud computing allows users to meet performance goals without maintaining expensive infrastructures. In particular, the booming applications of artificial intelligence and increasingly complicated neural networks for higher precision make offering inference services and/or training neural networks a major application of cloud computing. In many cases, the user data contains private information, such as patient images for medical diagnosis, genome samples for sequencing, and financial data for analysis. User data can be protected against eavesdropping by cryptography schemes during the transmission to and from cloud servers. However, if traditional cryptography schemes are utilized, decryption must be carried out before any computation is possible and the cloud server will get access to user private data. Privacy-preserving cloud computing and machine learning are enabled by the new homomorphic encryption (HE) technique, which allows computations to be directly carried out on encrypted data. Using HE, the cloud server does not gain any information on the user data and the computation results are encrypted. However, the achievable speed of HE implementations is far from being practical despite previous research efforts. This project aims to speed up HE implementations by orders of magnitude, expanding the privacy-preserving capabilities of cloud providers.    This project pursues scalability improvements by taking into account the specific computations involved in applications and integrating algorithmic reformulations with hardware architecture design. Such application-aware cross-layer design approaches can enable unprecedented complexity reduction. For the first time, new HE operators implementing combined computations with much reduced complexity will be investigated. In addition, the overall complexity of homomorphically encrypted neural networks will be further reduced by developing new techniques that enable the sharing of intermediate results and more efficient packing of data into ciphertexts. The algorithmic reformulation, new operator design, and computation optimization are carried out jointly with the corresponding hardware architecture design to truly speed up HE in real implementations. As a result of this project, HE hardware implementations achieving practical speed with low complexity will be developed for deep neural networks. The new designs can be also extended to other domains and will have significant impacts on privacy-preserving medical diagnoses, genome sequencing, data analytics, and many other applications.

However, the growing need for skills that match an emerging market of \u201celectric diesel\u201d equipment and other high-powered and highly networked equipment is increasing. To address the demand for upskilling, Minnesota North College will create an advanced diagnostics transportation micro-credential to build the immediate skills needed for new technicians to successfully transition to more sophisticated advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), hybrid and electric components testing, and networking. The proposed project will be designed to quickly develop students' skills and knowledge to align with industry needs through a five-course micro-credential. Courses will be available for second-year diesel mechanics and automotive technician students and field technicians. Over this three-year project, 12 students in two cohorts will be recruited to complete the certificate program. Based on the demographics of the region and college, and the comprehensive support services offered through college, a highly skilled diverse automotive and diesel workforce for the region will emerge.     This project aims to increase access to advanced diagnostic skills to supplement the after-market automotive sector, private contractor, and mining workforce in heavy equipment. The goal of the project is to upskill current and new cohorts of rural transportation technicians in advanced driver-assistance systems and advanced diagnostics with an emphasis on the recruitment of adult learners and women.

Current methods to analyze biodiversity and ecosystem services use costly remotely sensed data at the spatial resolution of cities and urban centers that are not sufficient for analysis at a local scale. Working with Indigenous communities, this project develops novel remote sensing methods using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to collect data at finer spatial and temporal resolutions that enable the analysis of local land change processes while the changes are occurring. This project's use of co-production of knowledge of land-use and land-cover change identifies the processes that trigger land-use change and thereby makes a significant contribution to research on scaling up methods that inform sustainable global economic processes. The tightly integrated research and education plans coupled with a summer institute broaden participation of underrepresented students and provides exceptional training in STEM research methods.     As land change scientists extend models for understanding the implications of change processes, it is essential to know how, when, and where the impacts of global level processes are manifested at local scales. To address these needs, this project catalogs change occurring at the local level using geospatial information technologies, including drones, and evaluates what forces drive change at the local level. Evaluation of local change processes will be completed in five different physical environments to determine whether and how policymakers respond to global-level drivers of change.

Sustainable green hydrogen production is a critical technology needed to ensure production of fuels and chemicals without carbon emissions. Platinum (Pt) is a key catalytic element utilized in electrochemical water splitting, but it is expensive.  The project focuses on novel electrocatalyst designs that utilize Pt atoms more efficiently than current practice for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).  The project contains broad-reaching educational and outreach activities aimed at providing underserved students with increased access to research facilities and STEM resources.      The project is aimed at studying the relationship between the local atomic structure and composition of the Pt microenvironments and HER mechanisms and kinetics. The project  focuses on the discovery of new degrees of freedom for tuning the activity of atom-efficient Pt-based catalytic materials rooted in: (1) understanding the effects of synthesis conditions on the surface topographic features, including exposed facets, low-coordinated surface sites, and interfaces, and on the structure and stability of supported and embedded Pt aggregates and (2) revealing the relationships between the structural and compositional configurations of these materials and their ability to promote the HER.  Experimental and theoretical approaches will be combined to investigate the effects of supporting Pt on a wide range of thin-film transition elements consisting of varying atomic size, electronegativity, electronic configuration, and crystalline structure.  The data obtained will be used to establish a robust model for the design of low-cost, high performing HER electrocatalysts.  From the broader impact perspective, the project will support the development of a well-trained STEM workforce. The partnership between faculties and students at Elizabeth City State University (ESCU) and partner institutions \u2013 including national laboratories - ensures that achieving the project\u2019s scientific goals is complemented by building foundations for research and education at ECSU that support the development of a diverse, equitable, and inclusive research community in the northeastern North Carolina region.    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

    "abstractText": "Wildfires are becoming more prevalent and are expanding out of wilderness areas and into the wildland-urban interface, including densely packed suburbs. The most devastating effects of these fires are apparent - the loss of homes, communities, and sometimes lives. Beyond the physical destruction, one unanswered question about the environmental impact of structure burning is whether fire liberates metal particles from household and structural components. Metals are found in everything from pipes to electronics to paints and pigments. Metals such as lead, copper, zinc, cadmium, and others can be toxic to the environment and humans. Once released, small metal particles can be transported by wind with subsequent deposition by rain and snow throughout different environments. The December 31, 2021 Marshall fire in Boulder County, Colorado burned more than 1000 structures, causing unknown effects on metal release to the surrounding environment. The research team at Colorado School of Mines will employ state of the art particle analysis techniques to determine if metal particles are present in ash samples from burned structures.  If found, further analysis will determine whether the concentrations are significant and humans are at risk from toxicological effects. The potential for metals to be absorbed by human lungs will be assessed by leaching metals from the ash into simulated lung fluids. The project will provide essential information to increase understanding of fire-derived metals while furthering analytical capabilities. The research team will hold virtual and classroom forums involving the Boulder community aimed at educating the community on the findings of the research, sharing the health impacts of nanoscale particles, and providing hands-on experiments for students.     The ash and smoke generated from the Marshall fire has the potential to be more harmful to both the environment and human health than materials generated from wildland fires.  Specifically, the anthropogenic materials burned may lead to the presence of metal-containing nanoparticles (diameter < 100 nm) in the resulting ash and soot.  The project goal over the next 12 months is to determine the amount of metal (Cu, Cd, Hg, Pb, Zn among others) present in nanoparticle form in ash and soot. The research team will collect samples from the area affected by the Marshall fire, focusing on ash from within burned homesites, nearby soils, and surface waters located downwind of the burned area.  Samples collected in non-urban, upwind sites will serve as controls. This RAPID project will utilize the novel technique of single particle Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to detect and quantify the nanoparticles present in deionized water suspensions.  The research team will investigate effects of particle size on metal bioaccessibility by performing single particle ICP-MS analysis as part of dissolution experiments using simulated lung fluids.  Timely analysis of the burned materials will advance knowledge of metal speciation in post-fire debris and may inform a responsible remediation effort with respect to human health and environmental impact.

    "abstractText": "This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing the use of evidence-based teaching practices in undergraduate computer science curricula. One such practice is project-based learning, which gives students opportunities to learn as they work on authentic real-world problems. Project-based learning, and other active learning practices, have been shown to increase student motivation and engagement, raise exam performance, and reduce failure rates. A major barrier to implementing project-based learning in the classroom is that instructors must provide students with the support they need to be successful learners as they complete project tasks.  Without that support, students can get bogged down performing unessential tasks instead of learning the targeted concepts and skills. This project aims to increase the use of project-based learning in software engineering courses.  To do so, the project will design, develop, and evaluate a reference software engineering course with a repository of twelve ready-to-use projects and associated active learning activities.  These resources will enable instructors to easily assign project tasks for students to complete at home.  It is anticipated that these resources will increase the capacity of instructors to effectively use project-based learning in their courses.  In addition, project-based learning can help students prepare for industry careers by providing learning experiences that are like the work that software engineers do.    The overarching goal of this project is to increase student learning by encouraging and facilitating authentic computer science learning experiences. Data for formative evaluation of the developed project-based learning resources will be gathered through advisory board reviews, undergraduate beta testing, and in-house classroom trials. Field tests at multiple volunteer sites will assess the feasibility of implementing the project-based learning resources in college or university settings. Finally, a pilot study will be performed to assess the promise of the developed materials to improve student learning outcomes. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. This project is in the Engaged Student Learning track, through which the IUSE program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.

    "abstractText": "Many natural and engineering flows, like wind gusts, water surges, or air moving over airplanes during maneuvers, can rapidly change speed and direction, i.e., under pulsation. These changes can be difficult to predict for flows over rough surfaces as surface protrusions create chaotic swirling and fluctuating forces in response to the shifting flow. Current prediction tools often assume smooth surfaces and steady conditions, leading to prediction errors or designs that work well in ideal scenarios but fail in real-world situations. The proposed project aims to deepen the understanding by conducting high-accuracy simulations that reveal detailed flow physics in pulsating flow over rough surfaces and develop new tools with unprecedented real-time prediction accuracy and off-design adaptability. The research will be integrated with comprehensive engagement initiatives that involve undergraduate students, community college students, and high schoolers in underrepresented regions to spark interest and cultivate skills in STEM. Outreach activities at a museum and Grade 5-12 schools will deliver accessible fluid-related STEM resources and captivating content to engage and educate the broader public.     The proposed project aims to tackle the knowledge and tool gaps via three perspectives: establishing a comprehensive high-resolution dataset of pulsating rough-wall flows, discovering new physical insights via novel statistical analysis, and conducting physics-based predictive modeling. The goals are to: 1) advance the understanding of pulsatile flows over roughened surfaces and how we characterize temporal and spatial coherence of turbulent boundary layers in general; 2) develop a novel set of accurate tools to quantitatively analyze and predict roughness effects in pulsatile flows. Direct numerical simulations and large-eddy simulations will resolve the roughness-scale flow to elucidate previously unexplored flow physics with direct measurements of wall stresses and velocity within the roughness region. Three roughness categories of increasing complexity, ranging from homogeneous to multiscale heterogeneous, will be addressed. In parallel, analytical physics-based models will be developed to explicitly account for drag production by roughness. Simulations will be complemented by collaborative experiments and industrial partnerships to establish a comprehensive research chain facilitating the practical implementation of findings. The improved predictive capability will reduce the design, operation, and maintenance costs of engineered products across aviation, energy, mechanical, meteorological, and environmental industries. Education activities will broaden the participation of individuals underserved in STEM education and research, which will promote education and career readiness, expand the talent pool, and contribute to economic development.

    "abstractText": "The human respiratory system relies on airway basal cells (BCs), a type of stem cell, to keep lungs healthy. These cells replace damaged cells and help remove debris and pathogens through a process called mucociliary clearance. The extracellular matrix (ECM), a network of proteins that provides structural support for these cells, significantly influences the ability of BCs to replicate and transform into different types of airway cells. Unfortunately, existing laboratory models do not fully mimic lung ECM, particularly factors like composition and stiffness, making it difficult to study how these environmental conditions influence BC behavior. This project aims to create a new material that simulates the composition and stiffness of lung tissue, which will allow researchers to control precisely the environment around BCs so they can explore how these factors affect how the cells grow, replicate, and differentiate into cells necessary for proper lung function. Results from this research may lead to new treatments for lung diseases, especially conditions that damage the airways. Beyond advancing lung disease research, this project will promote interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers among middle school students, particularly in underserved rural communities. Through a partnership with the educational app Couragion, the research findings will be transformed into interactive content, offering students a fun and engaging way to explore scientific careers.    This research aims to engineer a biomaterial platform to investigate how the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences airway basal stem cell (BC) self-renewal and differentiation. Current models such as air-liquid interface cultures and 3D organoids do not fully replicate the dynamic mechanical and biochemical environment of the lung ECM. To address these limitations, poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels that can dynamically stiffen to precisely control ECM composition and stiffness will be used. This interdisciplinary approach combines expertise in materials science, stem cell biology, and regenerative medicine to develop an advanced platform for studying cell-matrix interactions. The study will examine how variations in ECM stiffness and protein composition affect BC renewal and differentiation, and harness these environmental cues to reproducibly control cellular function. BC responses to tunable biomaterials will be assessed, focusing on outcomes such as cell proliferation, differentiation capacity, and gene expression. This project addresses significant gaps in understanding how the mechanical and biochemical ECM properties regulate BC function, with wide-reaching implications for tissue regeneration and disease modeling. The ability to separately control ECM stiffness and composition will offer new insights into how lung development and repair are managed at the cellular level.

    "abstractText": "This grant supports fundamental research in titanium alloys manufacturing and promotes the progress of science and engineering. Titanium alloys are promising structural materials due to their lightweight, high strength and toughness, high temperature and corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility and have many critical applications in transportation, such as airplane engine components, and healthcare, such as human implants. However, the manufacturing of titanium alloys requires the addition of expensive alloying elements and high processing temperatures, which leads to their high costs and significantly restricted commercial use. This project investigates the scientific mechanisms involved in deformation twinning and develops a prototype system for low-cost manufacturing of advanced lightweight titanium alloys. A combination of experimental, computation, and machine learning efforts is performed to search for new compositions of titanium alloys with low-cost alloying elements and activate novel deformation mechanisms in order to achieve their room-temperature manufacturing. The new knowledge generated by this project advances the titanium industry and promotes technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve human health, thus promoting national prosperity and welfare. This research provides a platform to train the next generation of titanium experts and skilled workforce, especially those from underrepresented groups, in the manufacturing of advanced materials as well as high-performance computing. This project is jointly funded by Advanced Manufacturing (AM) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).    This project aims to advance cost-effective room-temperature manufacturing of titanium alloys by a novel alloy design and processing strategy. In this strategy, a large portion (greater than 50 volume percent) of the body-centered cubic beta phase is stabilized at room temperature using low-cost elements after casting and homogenization processes. Furthermore, room-temperature ductility and workability of these alloys in the subsequent cold deformation process are improved by activating sufficient highly-indexed deformation twinning modes in the beta phase utilizing coupled twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) and transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) mechanisms. Two specific approaches, involving integration of experiment, simulation and machine learning, are followed. The first approach is to identify and tune the coupling mechanisms between phase transformations and highly-indexed twinning in representative titanium alloys through advanced characterization, crystallography models and atomistic simulations. The second approach is to manipulate and investigate alloying effects on twinning and room-temperature workability of these alloys by iterative feedback between the machine learning models, informed by first-principles calculations, and high-throughput fabrication and mechanical testing experiments. These results guide the discovery of beta phase stabilized titanium alloys containing low-cost alloying elements and attain high room-temperature workability. Finally, large-scale samples of titanium alloys with optimized compositions are cold deformation processed by rolling and drawing into specific shapes and tested for mechanical behavior to verify their room-temperature workability.

Examples range from autonomous vehicles and robots to computer-controlled factory lines and wearable medical devices. However, learning-enabled systems have shown to be very sensitive to training data and have difficulty in ensuring functional safety and robustness. The undesired outcomes of recent deployments, such as the accidents involving semi-autonomous vehicles, raise questions about the design principles needed to build learning-enabled systems that are safe. This project aims to develop the foundations of a novel methodology for the design and verification of learning-enabled CPS. It will pursue a compositional framework and computational tools that can reason about the uncertainty and approximation introduced by learning components and enable system design via a hierarchical and modular approach. The proposed research can have a highly positive influence on the design and real-world deployment of safe and cost-effective autonomous systems for a variety of applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and industrial automation. Moreover, it has the potential to offer a unifying framework for reasoning about a number of robust and fault-tolerant design approaches that are currently based mostly on ad hoc solutions. Collaborations with industry partners will be pursued to facilitate transitioning the research findings into practice. An educational plan including new undergraduate and graduate courses and a program for pre-college students will complement the research effort, aiming to educate the next generation of engineers and researchers on the concepts and the multidisciplinary attitude needed to realize \"intelligent\" systems that are safe, technologically and economically feasible, and seamlessly interacting with people.    The project develops a compositional framework for reasoning about the probabilistic behaviors of CPS built out of unreliable components. The framework relies on stochastic models of the interfaces between the components and their environments, termed deep contracts, together with rigorous rules for composing and refining them. Rich, quantitative, logic-based stochastic specification formalisms and data-driven modeling techniques will be leveraged to express and propagate computationally tractable representations of uncertainty at different abstraction levels. The framework will be vertically-integrated and offer mapping mechanisms to bridge heterogeneous models and heterogeneous decomposition architectures in the design hierarchy. It will provide computational tools to efficiently solve verification and synthesis problems with stochastic contracts. Finally, it will offer mechanisms to monitor requirements throughout the entire system life-cycle and provide assurance both at design time and runtime.

    "abstractText": "Climate change is pushing many organisms towards their limits, forcing species to move, evolve, or risk extinction. Frogs are among the most vulnerable species on the planet with roughly a third already under threat of extinction. Frogs, and other amphibians, can breathe across their skin. However, their permeable skin leaves frogs sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity, which is expected with climate change. Thus, understanding frog skin is key to understanding how frogs will react to climate change. Yet, knowledge of anuran skin evolution is surprisingly lacking. This project aims to measure variation in skin form and permeability and determine how skin variation affects key survival traits, like their ability to breathe and avoid dehydration. This project accomplishes a major goal in ecology by incorporating organismal physiology into predictions of climate vulnerability while simultaneously expanding our knowledge of a critically threatened animal group. Furthermore, frog \u201cskin breathing\u201d provides a framework to communicate complex topics ranging from evolution (e.g., convergence and adaptation) to physiology (e.g., oxygen transfer and water loss) to conservation (e.g., climate change). This project will: 1) mentor Native American students at USU and historically excluded students at ISU in research and 2) generate a low-cost, interactive, and publicly accessible frog skin activity focused on inquiry and discovery-based learning of evolutionary concepts.      The work seeks to understand how a universal constraint underlying gas exchange dictates climate vulnerability and ecology in an imperiled vertebrate clade. Balancing the need for gas exchange with the risk of dehydration creates predictable evolutionary trade-offs across the tree of life and has selected for adaptations that decouple gas exchange from water loss (e.g. unique nasal morphologies in mammals and birds, stomata density and size in plants). Despite understanding the role of these clade-specific adaptations for promoting life in xeric environments,relatively little is known about the evolution of universal structures, such as skin. With their nearly worldwide distribution and reliance on their skin for gas exchange, anurans are an ideal system to investigate how skin has evolved to balance oxygen uptake and water loss in response to varying environmental selection pressures. The proposed project has three aims: 1) quantify how frog skin has evolved over the past 200 million years and in-response to what abiotic and biotic factors, 2) experimentally test anuran skin\u2019s ability to decouple respiration and water loss, and 3) incorporate physiological data into activity budget models to improve an understanding of current anuran distributions and life-history evolution and predict species\u2019 vulnerability to future climate change. Our integration of morphology, physiology, and modeling will tie skin form and physiology to anuran ecology and biogeography to improve our understanding of anuran distributions, life-history evolution, and species\u2019 vulnerability to future climate change.

    "abstractText": "Methane is second only to carbon dioxide in its contribution to human-induced climate change due to its global warming potential, which is 34 times greater than that of CO2. Microorganisms in wet landscapes tend to release methane, whereas those in dry ones tend to take up the gas from Earth's atmosphere.  Researchers at the Howland Research Forest in Maine have been measuring methane fluctuations across this sub-boreal forest since 2012. Their studies have found that the forest usually serves as a methane \"sink\" due to microbial consumption, although occasionally, under extremely wet conditions, the reverse can be true.  This research site provides an ideal opportunity to study the conditions under which a forest would switch from a net sink to become a source of atmospheric methane. Under future climate change scenarios, the region is expected to become warmer and wetter, conditions that may induce a shift from methane sink to source, with the potential to have an impact on atmospheric methane concentrations at regional to global scale. This project will examine how forest soil microbial communities will change in response to climate warming, to identify the conditions that may lead forests to switch from being a methane sink to more of a source. The project will also support the cross-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral research scholars, including those from underrepresented groups in science. A series of public talks will be convened, and short videos and StoryMaps focused on science outreach will be paired with \u201cscientist in the classroom\u201d visits to local high schools. The project will host an open house for students and the public at the Howland Research Forest to learn about this important research.     This study aims to identify - through the integration of field observations, laboratory analyses, and modeling - the conditions and mechanisms driving methane sink vs source activity in forests, using the Howland Research Forest in Maine as a case study. The project's novel approach focuses on three key areas to improve understanding of methane in such habitats: 1) identify the roles and response of soil microbial communities, specifically, methanogens and methanotrophs (and their functional guilds), in driving methane flux across environmental gradients; 2) understand and quantify how wet vs dry landscape microsites, and belowground vs. aboveground components within a forest contribute to seasonal and annual methane fluxes; and 3) integrate knowledge gained from field and laboratory analyses to inform and improve ecosystem process models. A suite of in-situ and lab-based experimental measures of methane production and oxidation, stable isotopes, and profiles of microbial community composition and function will be used to understand the mechanisms, processes, and feedbacks driving methane sink/source activity from site to landscape levels. At the site level, multi-scale observations of soil and aboveground methane fluxes, microbial traits, and associated in-situ environmental conditions will be obtained. To further understand and quantify methane response, in-situ and laboratory manipulation experiments to identify the role of functional guild activity, under changing environmental conditions, in regulating methane production/oxidation and ultimately net methane flux to and from the atmosphere will be employed. Finally, these data, integrated with project data-enhanced Microbial Model for Methane Dynamics-Dual Arrhenius Michaels Menten (M3D-DAMM) and Community Land Model-Microbe (CLM-Microbe) process models, will allow researchers to identify seasonal and annual methane sink/source activity at the landscape level within Howland Forest from the present to 2100. The research will include training at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels, as well as a variety of outreach activities to engage high school students and the public.

    "abstractText": "Electric motors and generators play a crucial role in diverse industries, facilitating the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, enhancing industrial productivity, and harnessing renewable energy sources. Nonetheless, existing technologies heavily depend on costly rare-earth permanent magnets, which present significant obstacles to achieving sustainability objectives and promoting electrification efforts. The demand for rare-earth permanent magnets, such as neodymium iron boron (NdFeB), is expected to surge more than 20 times to fulfill sustainable energy and transportation goals by 2050. The projected demand for rare-earth magnets in offshore wind turbine and electric vehicle applications will reach 36.3% (273.7 kt) and 35.3% (266 kt), respectively, which is more than 70% of the total demand. Therefore, identifying motor drives that are free from rare-earth elements yet maintain high-performance and efficiency is a significant area of research.     This CAREER project aims to develop a magnetically integrated electric drive system with a topologically optimized magnet-free and brushless wound-field flux-switching (WFFS) motor, eliminating the need for expensive rare-earth permanent magnets. The research involves optimizing the motor design to eliminate inefficient magnetic flux paths, co-designing the motor and the inverter for high torque density and thermal performance, and accurately quantifying motor and drive losses for advanced control technique development. The outcomes of this research have broader implications for various sectors, including electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, more electric aircraft, and industrial processes, where electric drives are vital components. By providing an alternative to rare-earth magnet-based drives, the project seeks to revolutionize industry and contribute to the development of sustainable and high-power density electric drives. The research also addresses environmental concerns and supply chain challenges associated with rare-earth materials, promoting sustainability in the transportation and renewable energy sectors. The research outcomes will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field and have a lasting impact on the transition to cleaner energy sources and sustainable transportation systems.

    "abstractText": "Human communication has traditionally been dependent on sensory systems such as seeing, hearing, and/or touch, but words and symbols that are available to senders and are understood by receivers still limit most current communicative methods, even when they include non-verbal content. Brain-to-brain interface (B2BI) is an emerging technology that combines sensing the brain (brain-computer interface, or BCI) and stimulating the brain (computer-brain interface, or CBI) to enable communication between two brains directly through their neural activities. A BCI (for example electroencephalography- or EEG-based motor-imagery or MI BCI) reads a sender\u2019s brain activity and dispatches information to a CBI (for example, via transcranial magnetic stimulation), which activates a receiving brain, thereby facilitating direct brain-to-brain communication. Since its proof of concept in 2013, B2BI has been demonstrated in both animal models and human subjects where the same or different brain regions are recorded and stimulated in a variety of interesting contexts. Despite exciting advances in B2BI, there are still major gaps and barriers that need to be addressed, including but not limited to the lack of B2BI that work directly with neural information instead of indirectly through computer interpretation. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its innovative and integrative approach to developing an emergent neural interface technology that enables an individual\u2019s brain to communicate with another\u2019s by bypassing sensory exchange and language entirely.  Project outcomes will have broad impact in medical applications such as enhanced communication with behaviorally non-responsive or less-responsive patients, neuro-rehabilitation for stroke victims, and ultimately advanced communication for healthy users. The research will help facilitate the adoption of high-accuracy, image-guided, ultrasound technology in B2BI applications, and will produce the first truly bi-directional B2BI thereby laying the groundwork for the next step in human communication.      The overarching goal of this exploratory project is to create a direct bidirectional B2BI using non-invasive technology that combines a contemporary EEG-based MI BCI as the neuro-imaging technology and transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) as the neuro-stimulation technology. To this end, two objectives will be pursued:  First, we will determine the optimal parameters (including, duty cycle, inter-stimulus interval, and acoustic intensity) of the proposed excitatory tFUS. These parameters have been used in other studies, but not in a comparative analysis to determine the ideal combination. Furthermore, tFUS has been sparingly used with humans in a B2BI. Experiments will be conducted to develop and test parameters for tFUS modulation of the human brain, especially determining what values of key parameters produce the greatest excitatory response in a participant\u2019s brain. Then, a direct bidirectional B2BI built upon a MI BCI and the tFUS system resulting from the first objective will be assessed, with a focus on healthy human subjects in a more realistic task setting than those used in previous studies. The approach aims to replace the peripheral nervous system device with another BCI and CBI component, allowing brain information to be transmitted in both directions around the loop. Two research questions to be addressed include: Can the MI and tFUS based bidirectional B2BI system allow subjects to perform better than chance in a bidirectional collaborative task? and, Do the more detailed measures of performance (AUROC, bit rate, mutual information, and classifier accuracy) vary with task condition?

    "abstractText": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will support research to create a new class of made-to-order, 3D-printable soft robots with the capability to tolerate levels of structural deformations that would disable conventional approaches to computing and control. The goal of the project is to be able to rapidly design, fabricate, and deploy a highly customized fleet of robots to respond to unique and urgent missions. These robots would be able to, for example, navigate small, winding spaces in cave systems or debris fields, as might be required for robotic search-and-rescue or exploration. The synergistic use of mechanical intelligence, embedded fluidic circuits, and flexible electronics will enable these new robot capabilities. Mechanical intelligence - the use of robot geometry and material properties to adapt to unexpected conditions - can significantly reduce the amount of computing capacity needed for the robot to accomplish its goals. Fluidic logic uses the movement of fluid in flexible channels within the robot body to convert signals from contact sensors and other external stimuli into commands that turn robot actuators on and off. Fluidic logic can be directly built into the robot body and bend and twist without losing function. Finally, communication and control functions that are best performed electronically will be implemented using flexible and stretchable electronics with a high tolerance for dynamic deformation. The resulting robots will be able to implement sophisticated functionality, while undertaking severe shape changes as needed, to traverse otherwise inaccessible spaces. Comprehensive educational activities incorporate and complement the research, including a new hands-on undergraduate course on printable robotics, and an outreach program to public high schools in Worcester County.     This project will create robot architectures that can be quickly 3D printed using additive manufacturing techniques, to produce inexpensive robots that can crawl, jump, swim, and dive through confined spaces, and which can be rapidly customized to incorporate mission-specific details. The research goal is to 3D print robots with integrated fluidic state machines that respond to fluidic sensors and control fluidic actuators. A new class of complementary fluidic logic gates and electro-fluidic memory elements will be developed from multi-stable flexing beam structures with integrated linear actuators and fluidic tubing. Flexible electronic circuits and electro-fluidic interconnects will be integrated into the robots using conductive inks and elastomers. The role of electronics will be minimized and limited to selecting fluidic functionalities, functionalizing fluidic sensors and actuators, and writing programs into fluidic memory. The program will deliver a comprehensive robot architecture for terrestrial, underwater, and amphibious robots, including designs, fabrication processes, modeling and control methodologies, and software. The project will maintain a continuously evolving robot component library and will seek to build a community of researchers and potential users by sponsoring a sequence of increasingly challenging benchmarking scenarios inspired by the Tham Luang cave rescue in Thailand in 2018.

These experiments can engage tens of thousands of participants from around the world and enable citizen scientists to run their own experiments.  The ability to collect data from hundreds of experiments simultaneously increases the rate, robustness, and reliability of knowledge accumulation in psychology and the behavioral sciences. The Pushkin infrastructure lowers barriers to accessing the results from and participating in behavioral research, increases the diversity of both researchers and participants, and advances understanding across a wide range of disciplines and contexts, including social and educational programs and policies, product design, therapies, and training and development of artificial intelligence.     Pushkin is difficult to use even for those researchers who already conduct massive online experiments. The project adds functionality to Pushkin to make it easier to use.  Features are added that improve learning the software and that make it faster to write and deploy experiments. Additional functionality generates documentation of the collected data, including automatically generated statistical summaries.  The software will facilitate the use of best practices in data sharing, which in turn will increase researchers\u2019 willingness to share data and contribute to the rich datasets produced by massive online experiments.  Sharing of these datasets will support the development of new theories and models of behavior and broaden the impact of social science research.

    "abstractText": "Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) antenna systems will be an important technology for future mobile telecommunication networks to meet high data transfer rates, assured reliability, and reduced latency, all of which will enable many new and exciting applications. A key feature of mMIMO is the ability for directional transmissions by suitably coordinating the settings of large number of antenna elements, which requires careful alters the signal characteristics of phase and amplitude for each element. In collaboration with Torsten Braun at the University of Bern, Switzerland, this project aims to address the challenge of computing the parameters required to properly configure these massive antenna arrays in real time using the concepts of reinforcement learning and federated learning (FL). This project will forge new connections not only between the U.S. and Switzerland through collaborative research, bi-directional visits, and joint coursework development, but also between machine learning and wireless communities. The PIs will give also record short video tutorials on applied machine learning targeting wireless engineers, and release these on media-sharing platforms. Finally, all findings derived from the research activities, including position/vision papers, will be disseminated in top peer-reviewed conferences and journals in networking and communications.    Beamforming for directional transmissions in mMIMO involves adjusting the phase and amplitude of the transmitted signals to direct the signal to the intended receiver and minimize interference with other users. However, the channel estimation process, a pre-requisite step for setting precoding data bits transmitted over a multi-antenna system, can be computationally intensive and time consuming. This project considers the challenges associated with beamforming in an mMIMO system, significantly increasing the computational overhead over classical MIMO. Even with rapid strides in computing technology, classical processing cannot keep up with the demands of configuring an mMIMO system in real-time, such that the entire process is completed within the channel coherence time. The project has two major scientific objectives to address this challenge. It aims to advance the state-of-the-art in resilient and personalized channel estimation using (i) distributed and federated learning and (ii) multi-modal sensor data. For objective (i), the research will address challenges of contamination of pilot signals due to interference and design of personalized FL for channel estimation based on shared knowledge among. For objective (ii), the research will leverage multimodal sensor data, transfer learning and attention-based transformer neural networks to minimize model training costs and delay. The concepts, approaches, and algorithms developed will be validated in real-world experiments and simulations based on realistic collected data on the NSF Colosseum and in over-the-air testbeds. The data sets, code developed for the models and algorithms will be available for independent validation and re-use.

Yet most U.S. adults are skeptical of scientists\u2019 goodwill (e.g., commitment to public good). Goodwill is a key dimension of source credibility, a shortcut used by the public to interpret scientific findings and recommendations. Despite its key role, little is currently known about how goodwill emerges, varies and is contested across individuals and groups to motivate (or not) evidence-based action. This project will address this gap by identifying the key drivers of perceived technoscientific (TS) source goodwill and determining when and how technoscientific goodwill and communication shape responses to environmental messages among agricultural land operators (i.e., farmers, foresters, ranchers). Research findings will encourage efforts to incentivize evidence-based land stewardship that mitigates land-based climate emissions and maximizes the benefits of conservation science for people and the environment.     The proposed CAREER project will identify an improved evidence-based model of the factors shaping public perceptions of technoscientific (TA) source credibility and further efforts to measure, test, and employ goodwill as a means of promoting effective public communication. This research uses latent semantic analysis and mixed-methods content analysis to identify and compare the socio-cultural beliefs undergirding agricultural land operators and TS sources\u2019 mental models of source credibility. An online message experiment will be used to test the effects of goodwill signals and hedging on perceptions of TS source credibility and support for conservation practices on agricultural lands. Furthermore, this CAREER project integrates research and teaching with the development and evaluation of a novel educational curriculum that engages agricultural communities and prepares natural resource professionals to signal goodwill and recognize the cultural realities informing responses to evidence-based messages. As such, this project will provide a foundation for improved science communication training, more effective and evidence-based environmental messaging, and enhanced goodwill between agricultural communities and TS sources.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights a pressing need to understand the ecology and evolution of emerging viruses. These global dynamics are determined first and foremost by the genetic code of both viruses and their hosts, and by microscopic interactions between the two at the level of proteins and cells. However, biologists frequently struggle to connect theory across these scales. At the heart of this research effort is an open clearinghouse of big data, creating new opportunities to apply artificial intelligence to real-world problems. To foster a core set of data fluency and interdisciplinary research skills, the Lighthouse Learning Community will train participants at every career stage in the boundary-spanning science of the host-virus network, including more than 100 early career scientists. Undergraduates will be introduced to both biology and data science through a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience in \u201cThe Fundamentals of Disease Surveillance,\u201d while graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will explore these methods deeper through a biology integration workshop series, including a new Summer in the Capitol program in Washington, D.C. This cohort of emerging scholars will use open source materials, K-12 outreach, and digital media to harness public interest in emerging diseases like COVID-19, raising awareness about key issues while sharing the importance of basic biological research to save lives and protect ecosystems.    To identify the mechanistic and molecular Rules of Life that govern host-virus dynamics at planetary scales, the VERENA BII will leverage a unique mix of data synthesis, computational innovation, field sampling, and laboratory experiments to identify the molecular underpinnings of host-virus interactions. An unprecedented comparative study of the chiropteran within-host environment will generate and test hypotheses about the immunological adaptations that allow bats to tolerate deadly viruses.

Together, these model systems will illuminate the hard-coded basis of host-virus compatibility, supporting new machine learning methods to predict ecological and evolutionary networks and anticipate global risks of viral emergence in a changing climate. More broadly, the VERENA BII will expand an existing role as a hub of open data, software, and cyberinfrastructure for host-virus interactions, experimental virology, and wildlife disease surveillance.    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

    "abstractText": "This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant will contribute to the Nation's economic prosperity by developing analytical methods to enhance security and risk management of supply chains.  As a particular use case, the project will focus on sustainable seafood supply chain operations. The US is the second largest consumer of seafood in the world, and fisheries agencies are seeking substantial reforms in management practices to better manage fishery population dynamics.  The effectiveness of management strategies hinges upon fish stock assessment which is subject to many sources of uncertainties and noisy information, and is further compounded by illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which steals natural resources, threatens ocean ecosystems and seafood supply, and undermines port and maritime security. This award supports development of a new framework, analytics, and algorithms that can learn preferences and behavior of fishermen and fishing adversaries from imperfect data, identify ways to modulate their behavior, and search for effective strategies to promote sustainable operations and to combat IUU fishing. The educational plan will utilize similar methods to elicit students' needs and preferences from observable data and to design effective education strategies that promote inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility. The research will be informed through collaboration with the US Coast Guard Academy and the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries. In addition, tutorials and workshops on data analytics involving both students and supply chain practitioners will provide important recruitment and outreach opportunities.    This research will investigate a methodological framework comprising structural estimation, optimization, and integrated analysis for dynamic decision making under imperfect information. The current literature on learning and optimizing dynamic decisions mainly assumes that the system is perfectly observable. While there is an extensive literature on the analysis and optimization for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), this project will focus on the inverse estimation of the primitives of a POMDP model based upon observable histories, an understudied area.  Both optimization and inverse estimation for multi-party decision processes are also considered through partially observable Markov games (POMGs). This research address a knowledge gap by developing (i) new estimation methods to learn model parameters of POMDPs and POMGs from their corresponding data trajectories; (ii) efficient solution procedures for leader-follower POMGs with imprecise reward; and (iii) an integrated methodology of Estimation-Optimization-Analysis based on POMDPs and POMGs to improve an agent's performance by learning, targeted modulating, and adapting to other agents' decision behaviors. The methodologies will be applied to improve fish stock rebuilding efforts, support defense agencies in combating IUU fishing, and identify best practices of course delivery strategies in education.    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",
